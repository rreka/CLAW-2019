# CLAW-2019
A workshop on using data science skills and APIs to to assist with library collections assessment

## Description
This three-part workshop teaches people to use Python for the purpose of collections assessment. Starting with an introduction to the Python programming languages, users query the Scopus API to develop a dataset. Using the pandas library in Python, users can learn to organize, manipulate and work with the data in a data frame. Finally, users will learn about library link resolvers and how to work with them programmatically. 

## Getting started
### Requirements
To get full functionality from this workshop, users will need to be able to access the Scopus API. To do so, you must be connected to an internet network from an institution that subscribes to Scopus, and you must have a [Scopus API key](https://dev.elsevier.com/index.html).

If you don't have access to Scopus, you can skip the Scopus API part and use the example dataset for the subsequent sections (described in the workshop).

### Software
This workshop is built in Jupyter Notebooks, and a few Python libraries. I recommend downloading the Anaconda Python 3.7 distribution to get (almost) everything you need!
* [The Anaconda Python 3.7 distrubution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/)

One other Python library is required, [pybliometrics](https://github.com/pybliometrics-dev/pybliometrics), though the instructions in the workshop will guide you on how to install it.

### Installation
1. Download the files from this GitHub repository by clicking on **Clone or download**, and then on **Download ZIP**.
2. Unzip the files and place them somwehere on your computer.
3. Start Anaconda and start Jupyter Notebooks.
4. In Jupyter Notebooks, navigate to the files you just unzipped and click on Part I.
