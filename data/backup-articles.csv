Although this trait has been primarily studied in cephalopods, chameleons, and fishes, recent analyses suggest that dynamic dichromatism is prevalent among anurans and may be mediated through sexual selection and sex recognition. Yellow toads, Incilius luetkenii, exhibit dynamic dichromatism during explosive breeding events at the onset of the rainy season: males change from a cryptic brown to a bright yellow and back again during the brief mating event. We tested the hypothesis that dynamic dichromatism in yellow toads is influenced by conspecific interactions and mediated through sex hormones and stress hormones. We placed male toads into one of four social treatments (with three other males, one male, one female, or no other toads). Immediately before and after each one-hour treatment, we quantified male colour with a reflectance spectrometer and we collected a blood sample to assess plasma concentrations of both testosterone and corticosterone. We found that males held with conspecific animals showed the brightest yellow colour and showed little or no change in their corticosterone levels. Across treatments, toads with duller yellow colour had higher levels of corticosterone. Male colour showed no association with testosterone. Interestingly, males showed substantial temporal variation in colour and corticosterone: toads were duller yellow and exhibited greater levels of corticosterone post-treatment across subsequent days at the onset of the rainy season. Our findings reveal that both conspecific interactions and corticosterone are involved in the dynamic colour change of yellow toads.",Bufo luetkenii | Colour change | Corticosterone | Dynamic sexual dichromatism | Incilius luetkenii | Reflectance spectrometry | Sexual selection | Testosterone | Yellow toad,0,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

This population was compared to a reference farm site located 40 km east in Glen Valley. We analyzed samples of European starling eggs and nestling livers as well as invertebrate prey species consumed by starlings for PBDE concentrations.

Stable nitrogen (δ N15) and carbon (δ C13) isotope analysis of starling blood samples and provisioned invertebrates revealed that stable δC13 signatures differed between the sites indicating that the diet of starlings in the Delta landfill included a component of human refuse.

Cyanobacteria blooms are increasing globally, with further increases predicted in association with climate change. Recently, some cyanobacteria species have been identified as a source of estrogenic effects in aquatic animals. To explore possible estrogenic effects of Microcystis aeruginosa (an often-dominant cyanobacteria species) on zooplankton, we examined effects of cyanobacteria exudates (MaE, 2 × 104 and 4 × 105 cells/ml) on reproduction in Daphnia magna. We analyzed physiological, biochemical and molecular characteristics of exposed Daphnia via both chronic and acute exposures. MaE at both low and high cell density enhanced egg number (15.4% and 23.3%, respectively) and reproduction (37.7% and 52.4%, respectively) in D. magna similar to 10 μg/L estradiol exposure. In addition, both MaE of low and high cell densities increased population growth rate (15.8% and 19.6%, respectively) and reproductive potential (60% and 83%, respectively) of D. magna. These exudates promoted D. magna reproduction by stimulating 17β-hydroxysteroid-dehydrogenase (17β-HSD) activity and production of ecdysone and juvenile hormone, and by enhancing vitellogenin biosynthesis via up-regulating expression of Vtg1 and Vtg2. However, increased expression (6.6 times higher than controls) of a detoxification gene (CYP360A8) indicated that MaE might also induce toxicity in D. magna. Reproductive interference of zooplankton by blooming cyanobacteria might negatively affect foodwebs because MaE-induced zooplankton population increase would enhance grazing and reduce abundance of edible algae, thereby adding to the list of known disruptive properties of cyanobacterial blooms.",Cyanobacteria | Daphnia magna | Endocrine disorder | Estrogen analogue | Estrogenic effect | Microcystis aeruginosa,0,0,NSFC,2017M623078,China Postdoctoral Science Foundation

The perception of a sound can be influenced by another sound in a space-dependent manner. An understanding of this perceptual phenomenon depends on knowledge about how the spatial relationship between two sounds affects neural responses to the sounds. We used the rat as a model system and equal-probability two-tone sequences as stimuli to evaluate how spatial separation between two asynchronously recurring sounds affected responses to the sounds in midbrain auditory neurons. We found that responses elicited by two tone bursts when they were colocalized at the ear contralateral to the neuron were different from the responses elicited by the same sounds when they were separated with one at the contralateral ear while the other at another location. For neurons with transient sound-driven firing and not responsive to stimulation presented at the ipsilateral ear, the response to a sound with a fixed location at the contralateral ear was enhanced when the second sound was separated. These neurons were likely important for detecting a sound in the presence of a spatially separated competing sound. Our results suggest that mechanisms underlying effects of spatial separation on neural responses to sounds may include adaptation and long-lasting binaural excitatory/inhibitory interaction.",,0,1,NSERC,undefined,University of Windsor

To understand brain changes caused by auditory sensory deprivation, we recorded local-field potentials in the inferior colliculus of young adult rats with neonatal cochlear damage produced by systemic injections of amikacin. The responses were elicited by electrical stimulation of the entire cochlea and recorded at various locations along a dorsolateral-ventromedial axis of the inferior colliculus. We found that hair cells were completely destroyed and spiral ganglion neurons were severely damaged in the basal cochleae of amikacin-treated animals. Hair cells as well as spiral ganglion neurons were damaged also in the middle and apical areas of the cochlea, with the damage being greater in the middle than the apical area. Amplitudes of local-field potentials were reduced in the ventromedial inferior colliculus, but enhanced in the dorsolateral inferior colliculus. Latencies of responses were increased over the entire structure. The enhancement of responses in the dorsolateral inferior colliculus was in contrast with the damage of hair cells and spiral ganglion cells in the apical part of the cochlea. This contrast along with the overall increase of latencies suggests that early cochlear damage can alter neural mechanisms within the inferior colliculus and/or the inputs to this midbrain structure.",,0,1,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Microbial community function in freshwater sediments is influenced by the presence and persistence of anthropogenic pollutants, yet simultaneously imposes significant control on their transformation. Thus, microbes provide valuable ecosystem services in terms of biodegradation and bioindicators of compromised habitats. From a remediation perspective it is valuable to leverage the suite of microbial genes at the transcriptional level that are active in either natural versus stressed environments to provide insight into the cycling and fate of contaminants. Metatranscriptomic analysis of total bacterial and archaeal messenger RNA (mRNA) is a useful tool in this facet and was applied to sediments sampled from the Detroit River; a binational Area of Concern (AOC) in the Great Lakes. Previously established sediment surveys and modelling delineated the river into contaminant gradients based on concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and metals. Differential expression analysis through DESeq2 revealed that microbial transcripts associated with nitrate reduction, methanogenesis, and beta-oxidation were significant in legacy polluted sediments and linked with energetic pathways key in the generation of cellular currencies (acetyl-CoA, succinyl-CoA). Gluconeogenesis and polyester synthesis also showed high abundance in contaminated regions, along with increased expression of stress response genes and transposons, despite decreases in community α-diversity. Aromatic cleavage genes were detected, but in low abundance across the contaminant gradient. These results suggest that microbial communities within the Detroit River exploit unique anabolic and catabolic pathways to derive and store energy from legacy organic contaminants while simultaneously recruiting stress-response and gene transfer mechanisms to cope with xenobiotic pressures. By coupling well-resolved chemical datasets with metatranscriptomics, this study adds to the spatial understanding of in-situ microbial activities in pristine and perturbed freshwater sediments.",Differential expression | Legacy contaminants | Metatranscriptomics | Polyhydroxyalkanoate synthesis | Sediments | Transposases,0,0,NSERC,DG-04960,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

The “zeep” complex consists of nine birds that produce nocturnal flight calls with similar acoustic features. Our inability to distinguish these calls inhibits the acoustic monitoring of these species. We test the hypothesis that flight calls of nine warblers in the “zeep” complex show sufficient acoustic differences to allow differentiation. We investigate divergence in these vocalizations by recording birds held for banding and collecting additional recordings from sound libraries. We used three approaches to compare calls between species: analysis of variance in acoustic properties, discriminant analysis of acoustic properties, and spectrographic cross-correlation. The first approach revealed five species that were different in one or more acoustic properties. The second approach revealed a level of assignment to the correct species (73%) that exceeded levels expected by chance (36%). The third approach revealed calls of seven species to be significantly more similar to conspecific calls than heterospecific calls. Our results suggest the calls of many members of the “zeep” complex exhibit species-specific differences in structure, which may allow differentiation of at least five “zeep” species based on call alone.

The most probable number dilution-culture assay (MPN) is used to enumerate viable phytoplankton in regulatory tests of ballast water treatment systems. However the United States Coast Guard has not yet accepted MPN, in part due to concerns of biased results due to cells being viable but not growing. MPN does not assess the fate of every cell, and thus the bias can only be evaluated by a companion method that assesses the ability of the various taxa to grow. This growth ability (""growability"") is the complement of the bias, and has been evaluated by microscopic taxonomy of before-culture and after-culture samples. However, microscopic taxonomy is extremely laborious and few data have been produced for phytoplankton growability in MPN assays. To address the need for more and more reliable growability data, a method was developed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) and quantitative real time PCR (qRT-PCR) techniques that target the V9 region of the 18S rRNA gene for the taxonomic identification and growth assessment of eukaryotic phytoplankton, respectively. This growability method was applied to MPN samples from a ballast water management system test that were incubated with two different enrichment media at two different temperatures. DNA was extracted from filters of before-culture and after-culture samples, and assessed for taxonomy by NGS and for PCR template DNA concentration by qRT-PCR. Growth ratios based on changes in 18S template concentration over the incubation period were calculated for each taxon, and dead-cell DNA persistence through a 14 day incubation was verified to be <1% and did not influence the growth calculations. In total, 95 of 97 eukaryotic phytoplankton in the before-culture sample demonstrated growth, with definitive growth ratios ranging from 4.0 × 101-2.6 × 105. An additional 13 taxa demonstrated growth from non-detect in before-culture samples. Taxa-based growability values were 87-88% in individual incubation conditions with no statistical differences among conditions, and 98% for all conditions combined. When growability was weighted by the before-culture abundance of each taxa, relevant to regulations based on all organisms regardless of taxa, community-based growability was >99% in each condition and in all conditions combined because the most abundant taxa all exhibited growth. This study verifies that conventional phytoplankton MPN assays produce accurate results with low bias from undetected viable cells, regardless of enrichments and incubation temperatures.

Salmon farming is one of Canada's fastest growing industries and contributes to Canada's economy as well as creating jobs in rural areas; however, the industry is challenged by the need to balance production economics against environmental impacts. While Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are the most commonly farmed species on the west coast of Canada, Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) are a valuable alternative, as they fill a niche market and generate reduced environmental concerns because they are a native species. However, Chinook salmon have not been systematically domesticated, and their performance remains highly variable. Here we report on the results of a research program designed to develop a performance-enhanced hybrid Chinook salmon stock. Growth and survival were estimated for seven domestic-wild hybrid Chinook salmon crosses at various freshwater stages and during 15 months of saltwater rearing at a British Columbia Chinook salmon farm and compared with domestic-domestic crosses (control). The project included 8640 individually (PIT) tagged offspring from the domestic stock and seven domestic-wild hybrid stocks originating from the Lower Fraser Valley, Lower Mainland Vancouver, and Vancouver Island, British Columbia, Canada. Within each stock, milt from 10 sires was used to fertilize eggs pooled from 15 highly inbred domestic females to produce 80 half-sib families. Our breeding design allows the partitioning of stock and sire effects, and minimises maternal genetic and maternal environment effects. Replicates of all families were reared under common environmental conditions in both fresh- and salt water and monitored for body size and survival. There was significant variation in survival, body size, and saltwater biomass among the Chinook salmon hybrid stocks. The performance of some of the hybrid crosses exceeded that of the fully domesticated stock, although the pattern of performance varied with rearing stage. Overall, two hybrid stocks consistently outperformed the domestic stock in terms of survival, growth, and biomass estimates. We systematically assess production performance across a wide range of wild-domestic hybrid crosses in a Pacific salmon species, and our results highlight opportunities to improve the production performance of Chinook salmon culture.",Aquaculture | Biomass | Chinook salmon | Growth | Heterozygosity | Hybridization | Outcross | Survival,2,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Identifying biomarkers for better diagnosis or prognosis of breast cancer is in demand but presents many challenges. In this study, we introduced a data-integration approach to identify sub-network biomarkers capable of predicting breast cancer treatment outcomes including disease-free survival, and overall survival at five years and long-term. A gene expression data is used for evaluating the predictive power of sub-networks of genes, while the protein-protein interaction network is to guide the search for the candidate sub-networks. To reduce the search space, we proposed a score to estimate the predictive ability of a set of genes, thus, only the candidates with the high score are evaluated by Support Vector Machine classifier during the search. After the sub-networks with highest classification performance were selected for all seed genes, they were further analyzed with pathway data and cancer-related genes from literature for their biological meaning. The selected sub-networks yielded highly accurate and contain genes associated with many cancer pathways, including breast cancer.",Breast cancer biomarker | Network-based method | PA score | Sub-network selection | Survivability prediction,0,1,,undefined,

Nomadic movements of migratory birds are difficult to study, as the scale is beyond the capabilities of hand-held telemetry (10 s of kms) but too fine-scale for long-range tracking devices like geolocators (50–100 km accuracy). Recent widespread installation of automated telemetry receiving stations allowed us, for the first time, to quantify and test predictions about within-winter movements of a presumed nomadic species, the Snow Bunting (Pletrophenax nivalis). We deployed coded radio-transmitters on 40 individual Snow Buntings during two winters (2015-16 and 2016-17) in southern Ontario, Canada, and tracked movements over a 300 by 300 km area with 69–77 active radio-receiving stations (Motus Wildlife Tracking Network). To complement our tracking data, we also examined the influence of weather on the demographics of winter flocks at a single wintering site over 6 consecutive years (n = 9312 tagged birds). We recorded movements of 25 Snow Buntings from the deployment sites to 1–6 different radio recievers (mean 2.68 locations/bird). Birds traveled a minimum average distance of 49 km between detections (range: 3 to 490 km) in the core wintering period of Dec-Feb, and cumulative total movements ranged from 3 to 740 km (average 121 ± 46 km). In March distances between detections increased to an average of 110 km, suggesting an extended early-migration period. Overall, older birds (after-second year or older) tended to move more (higher cumulative distances traveled) than younger (first winter) birds, even during the Dec-Feb period. The long-term banding data revealed that larger, male birds were more likely to be captured in colder and snowier weather, relative to female and smaller birds, suggesting that they can withstand these conditions more easily owing to their body size. We have provided the first direct-tracking data on nomadic winter movements of Snow Buntings, and tested the hypothesis that winter weather drives flock composition at a single site. Site-specific banding data suggest that weather-related changes in flock composition could explain the nomadic, landscape-scale movements of Snow Buntings we observed by using automated telemetry. Future work should explore the importance of resource availability, competition, and predation risk as drivers of winter movements in Snow Buntings.",differential migration | irruptive migration | movement ecology | nomadic migration | songbird | telemetry | weather,0,1,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

For a young animal that is learning to vocalize, eavesdropping on vocal interactions between adults may provide a rich source of information: young animals might preferentially learn vocalizations that are commonly heard in interactions between adults or that are heard to be effective for attracting mates or defending resources. We used a multispeaker playback experiment with wild Savannah sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, to test the hypothesis that vocal learning is guided by eavesdropping. Over a 6-year period, we tutored young Savannah sparrows with experimental tutor songs; half of the tutor songs were broadcast in simulated vocal interactions between two tutors, and the other half were broadcast as noninteractive, stand-alone solo performances. If eavesdropping plays an important role in guiding vocal learning, we predicted that young birds would preferentially learn the vocalizations heard during interactions between tutors. In contrast to our prediction, young Savannah sparrows did not preferentially learn interactive tutor songs; birds were similarly likely to learn songs heard in an interactive context (N = 13) and in a noninteractive context (N = 17). Analysis of live adult tutors' reactions to the loudspeakers showed that they responded with similar vocal behaviour during interactive and noninteractive treatments, and therefore their vocal behaviour did not compromise the playback simulation. We conclude that eavesdropping on vocal interactions between tutors does not appear to be essential for vocal learning of wild Savannah sparrows.",birdsong | Passerculus sandwichensis | playback | Savannah sparrow | vocal learning,0,0,,undefined,

Water quality impacts to the Laurentian Great Lakes create bi-national issues that have been subject of investigation since the 1970s. However, distinguishing upgradient sources of nutrients, metals and legacy contaminants in rivers remains a challenge, as they are derived from multiple sources and flows typically vary throughout the region. These complications are especially pertinent in the Lake Huron to Lake Erie corridor and Detroit River. The Detroit River supplies 90% of the water to the western basin of Lake Erie (5300 m3/s)and is subject to a variety of co-occurring potential sources (e.g., agriculture, urbanization, and upgradient water bodies)of water quality indicators that limit source disaggregation. To find the source signal in the noise we used an integrative interpretation of dissolved chemical and isotopic parameters with sediment chemical, isotopic, and contaminant indicators. The approach combines archival data to distinguish point and non-point sources, and upgradient water bodies as sources of nutrients, metals and contaminants to the Detroit River and ultimately the western basin of Lake Erie. Persistent organic pollutants and metals cluster together as an urban group. Regional dissolved orthro-phosphate (PO4)in the water column also groups with urban point sources rather than agricultural sources. Urbanization as the primary source of PO4 in the Detroit River highlights the need for continued research on urban impacts and assessments of broader best management practices protecting Lake Erie.",Detroit River | Dissolved nutrients | Laurentian Great Lakes | Non-point source | Point source,0,0,,GCXE16R166,

Globally, small agricultural waterways fed by springs, tile drains, and seeps can disproportionately contribute to downstream nutrient loading, which is associated with declines in water quality and ecosystem functions. Treating nitrate using a multiple tool, multiple-scale approach in small waterways could offer improved management of these sources. We used a before-after-control-impact design to test the suitability of three small (<30 m3) edge-of-field denitrifying woodchip bioreactors and stream bank re-shaping and riparian planting. Over three-and-a-half-years, riparian rehabilitation enhanced nitrate flux attenuation compared to pre-rehabilitation, but only under relatively low flow conditions. In comparison, there were no significant changes in nitrate flux in a control waterway under any flow condition. N fluxes always increased in both the control and treatment waterways when reaches gained water downstream. Nitrate removal efficiencies for all three bioreactors ranged from <10 to >99%, with performance variations due to short residence times and fluctuations in source water chemistry. A single tile drain bioreactor removed 0.41 kg NO3-N d−1, equivalent to ∼10% of the mean daily tile drain nitrate load. Greenhouse gas fluxes from the tile drain bioreactor were similar to the surrounding pasture (CO2-C mean: 185–286 mg C m2 h−1; N2O-N mean: 49–90 μg N m2 h−1), suggesting no negative impacts from the bioreactor. Overall, our results suggest a multiple-tool, multiple-scale application of rehabilitation tools can reduce downstream N fluxes, but only under certain flow conditions. Thus, local rehabilitation tools, like those trialed here, will need to be scaled appropriately if they are to significantly attenuate nutrient losses from small agricultural waterways. Moreover, these will not replace catchment-scale nutrient plans to address losses from land and legacy groundwater N pollution.",Agricultural land-use | Denitrification | Denitrifying woodchip bioreactor | Greenhouse gas | Nitrate-nitrogen flux | Tile drainage,0,0,,undefined,

To illustrate the application of functional diversity in conservation planning, we used data from a large-scale monitoring program to characterize patterns in functional and taxonomic fish biodiversity across coastal freshwater wetlands in northern Laurentian Great Lakes. We assessed the relationship between these 2 types of diversity to identify areas most likely to maximize conservation benefits in terms of these dimensions of biodiversity. In addition, we used an outlier analysis to find areas with unexpectedly high taxonomic or functional diversity in highly impacted watersheds, or bright spots. Taxonomic and functional fish diversity metrics were not closely related, and different areas across the basin supported highest taxonomic and functional diversities. Several bright spots had either very high taxonomic richness or functional diversity despite intensive anthropogenic land use, possibly indicating high resilience and conservation potential. These findings are relevant in the context of freshwater protected area prioritization because there are few guidelines available for nomination and selection of new freshwater protected areas.",Conservation prioritization | Freshwater fish | Freshwater protected areas | Functional evenness | Great Lakes | Outlier analysis,1,0,EPA,GL-00E00612-0,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

Effective ocean management and the conservation of highly migratory species depend on resolving the overlap between animal movements and distributions, and fishing effort. However, this information is lacking at a global scale. Here we show, using a big-data approach that combines satellite-tracked movements of pelagic sharks and global fishing fleets, that 24% of the mean monthly space used by sharks falls under the footprint of pelagic longline fisheries. Space-use hotspots of commercially valuable sharks and of internationally protected species had the highest overlap with longlines (up to 76% and 64%, respectively), and were also associated with significant increases in fishing effort. We conclude that pelagic sharks have limited spatial refuge from current levels of fishing effort in marine areas beyond national jurisdictions (the high seas). Our results demonstrate an urgent need for conservation and management measures at high-seas hotspots of shark space use, and highlight the potential of simultaneous satellite surveillance of megafauna and fishers as a tool for near-real-time, dynamic management.",,2,0,NERC,2020,National Eye Research Centre

Animals have an endogenous circadian clock that temporally regulates 24 hour (h) oscillations in behavior and physiology. This highly conserved mechanism consists of two positive regulators, Bmal and Clock, and two negative regulators, Cry and Per, that run with a 24-h cycle that synchronizes itself with environmental changes in light, food, and temperature. We examined the circadian clock in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), a non-model organism in which the function of the clock has not been studied. Recent studies indicate that clock genes in Chinook salmon play a role in its evolution of local adaptation, possibly by influencing migration timing. We designed real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays to quantify the transcription of components of the clock system, and validated these for PCR efficiency and specificity in detecting Chinook target genes. Chinook salmon tissue samples were collected in 3-h intervals, over the course of 24 h, from five different organs. Our data indicate that the circadian clock functions differently in each of these tissues. In the liver, positive and negative regulators exhibit anti-phasic peaking in the evening and morning, respectively. However, in the heart, these same regulators peak and trough with a different timing, indicating that the liver and heart are not synchronous. The digestive tract displays yet another difference: simultaneous phases in the expression of positive and negative clock regulators, and we do not observe significant rhythms in clock gene expression in the retina. Our data show that there is a functional clock in Chinook salmon tissues, but that this clock behaves in a tissue-specific manner, regardless of the whole animal being exposed to the same environmental cues. These results highlight the adaptive role of the clock in Chinook salmon and that it may have different positive and negative effects depending on tissue function.",Chinook salmon | clock genes | feeding entrainment | peripheral clocks | rhythms,0,0,"CANRIMT, NSERC",undefined,"Canadian Network for Research and Innovation in Machining Technology, Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada"

Although insect evidence was photographed and collected at the scene and autopsy, this evidence was not used in the 1959 trial. Instead, time of death was pinpointed to a 45-min window of 1900–1945 h on 9 June 1959 based on stomach content analysis. Based on circumstantial evidence and this time frame that he was the last suspect to see her alive, 14-year old Steven Truscott was convicted of her murder. He was scheduled to be hanged, but a temporary reprieve postponed his execution. In 1960, his death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment. Truscott was the youngest person to be sentenced to death in Canada, and his case provided the major impetus toward abolition of the death penalty in Canada. Truscott always maintained his innocence. In 2001, the Association in Defence of the Wrongly Convicted filed an appeal to have the case reopened. In 2006, the authors of this paper were contacted by Attorneys James Lockyer and Phil Campbell of the LCP Law Firm in Toronto to investigate this case. Fresh evidence was presented at the Ontario Court of Appeal in 2006–2007 including testimony of 3 forensic entomologists. This resulted in controversy regarding identification of the insects and assumptions of insect behaviour that affected the postmortem interval estimate. Lack of scientific evidence for the controversial theories proposed by one testifying entomologist resulted in disregarding his testimony. Instead, testimony by VanLaerhoven and Merritt was accepted. Based on their analysis and a re-creation experiment of the insect evidence, initial fly colonization occurred during daylight hours of 10 June 1959. The collected larvae were not likely to have been deposited on the body before dark (2140 h) on 9 June 1959 as this would have resulted in significantly larger and more advanced larval instar than were collected at the scene or autopsy. This analysis, together with a pathology reanalysis of stomach content analysis, demonstrated that the original estimate of time of death was unreliable. Truscott was with numerous witnesses prior to 1900 h and after 2000 h on 9 June 1959, thus the estimate of time of death was the most critical evidence in the original 1959 trial and the 2006–2007 appeal. On 28 August 2007, his conviction was overturned, declared a wrongful conviction and miscarriage of justice.

Because not all captures are intentional, for instance when capture methods have low selectivity, pressure on these species may be lessened by releasing living incidentally caught animals. However, it is often unrealistic to expect people to voluntarily do so because it means foregoing the benefits of resource extraction. Financial incentives for such animal release may foster conservation objectives. Reducing human–animal conflicts, protecting natural habitat, and conserving nests of threatened species are examples of conservation benefits that can be built on financial reward systems. However, incentives aiming to protect unintentionally captured threatened species are scarce. We considered pay for release, a type of ecosystem-service payment designed to foster the release of incidentally captured threatened species. We aimed to determine the best conditions to implement this scheme, its potential benefits (e.g., incentivizing the release of threatened species), and pitfalls and priority research needs (e.g., required conditions for pay for release to work) to show that its global applicability is possible. Given that approaches solely based on education and law enforcement may be ineffective under some circumstances, we argue that pay for release can protect incidentally captured endangered species if used under conditions conducive for its success. When local participants’ intrinsic motivation for conservation is weak, but the release of incidentally live-caught animals into their habitats is readily achievable, pay-for-release schemes could jump start urgently needed conservation efforts against indiscriminate animal harvesting.",bycatch | conservation method | financial rewards | local livelihoods | sawfishes | trust-based interactions | unselective capture methods,1,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

While outbreeding is a common method used to introduce variation to a broodstock in aquaculture to maintain healthy genetic stocks, little consideration is given to identifying stocks that can experience easy acclimation to captivity. Because the ability of individuals to behaviourally adjust to novel captive conditions influences who will reach broodstock age, behaviours can be used to screen for potential source stocks for outbreeding. To determine the effects outbreeding has on the variation of behavioural phenotypes produced, and whether these phenotypes can be predictive of growth and survival to captive conditions, an experimental design was created consisting of seven wild-domestic hybrid stocks of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and domesticated control stock. Behavioural assays were conducted on the same captive individuals as juveniles in fresh water and sub-adults in salt water to test for the occurrence of acclimation / growth-maximizing behavioural phenotypes such as flexibility: exploration, neophilia, and predator responsiveness; and growth-promotion: sociality, activity, and food-motivation. These behaviours were then contrasted against performance (growth and survival) within and across life-history stages. We found inter-population variation in four distinct behavioural types at each life-history stage. Still, we found individuals that were less shy (LMM: β = -0.14, P < 0.001), or inactive (β = -0.32, P = 0.004), or more social (β = 0.018, P = 0.01) as juveniles; or were risk-averse (β = 0.022, P = 0.056) as sub-adults experienced greater short and/or long-term performance. While not one behavioural type emerged in predictive power of performance, better performing stocks possessed more of these desired behavioural traits. By identifying which behavioural attributes contribute most to first-generation acclimation, screening tools can be developed to recommend natural populations for outcrossing, balancing both production and animal welfare.",Acclimation | Aquaculture | Behavioural flexibility | Chinook salmon | Performance,0,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Background: The vocalizations of birds are dynamic traits that often vary in output with time of day and time of year. By quantifying patterns of diel and seasonal variation in vocal output, we can gain insight into the ecology and evolution of birds and the function of their vocalizations. In this investigation, we quantified diel and seasonal variation in song output by studying a breeding population of Savannah Sparrows (Passerculus sandwichensis). Methods: We used autonomous recorders to collect extensive recordings across the breeding season in a long-term, colour-marked study population of Savannah Sparrows in eastern Canada. We described diel and seasonal variation across five different breeding stages based on recordings of more than 50,000 songs from 34 males. Results: During the pre-breeding stage, prior to female arrival, males sang a pronounced dawn chorus with a peak in song output during the early morning. During the breeding stage, in contrast, the dawn chorus was diminished and males instead exhibited a pronounced dusk chorus with a peak in song output during the evening. Across the breeding season, the highest levels of song output occurred in late April and early May, soon after males arrived on the breeding grounds, and the lowest levels occurred in August, prior to the departure of birds for the wintering grounds. Conclusions: These patterns suggest that Savannah Sparrows' early-season dawn choruses are directed at males and serve a territorial defense function. Later-season dusk choruses, in contrast, appear to play a role in attracting mates and possibly acoustic mate guarding.",Bird song | Breeding activities | Circadian rhythms | Seasonal variation in song,1,1,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Many birds change their partners every year and pairing may occur before arrival on the breeding grounds. Early pairing strategies can benefit mates by strengthening pair-bonds and increasing the rate of pre-breeding resource acquisition, leading to increased reproductive output and success, especially for migratory species breeding in seasonally-constrained environments like the Arctic. Despite the theorized and documented advantages of early pairing, we know rather little about pairing phenology in many species. Here, we test the use of a stable isotope (carbon δ13C) method to assign geographic origin of paired birds to examine pairing phenology in Arctic-breeding Common Eiders (Somateria mollissima borealis). During two consecutive years, we captured paired individuals upon their arrival at breeding grounds approximately 2–3 weeks before laying. Pairs with similar δ13C in their claws indicates that they paired during winter, while similar blood values (with no similarity in claws) would reveal pairs formed much later, during the pre-breeding period near or on the breeding grounds. While a large proportion of pairs (43%) appeared to pair on wintering grounds, an almost equal number (52%) likely paired within 1 month prior to arrival on the breeding grounds. The remaining 5% did not have an obvious pairing time. Despite this variability in pairing phenology, we found no significant differences in body condition between females or males which paired in winter or spring. In the year characterized with more challenging winter conditions, pairs formed in spring tended to have a higher breeding propensity than those formed in winter, although there were no detectable links to body condition. Delaying pairing until spring may be advantageous for Arctic-breeding eiders, although a specific mechanism is unknown. Future research focusing on the energetic costs and benefits for male eiders during these periods would help further understand pairing phenology and potential impacts on males of female breeding decisions.",Pair bond | Pairing phenology | Sea duck | Spring staging | Stable isotope analysis | Winter migration,1,0,,undefined,

Metal-contaminated sediments in lakes is a global concern that poses toxicological risk to aquatic organisms. This study performed bioassays using the submerged macrophyte, Vallisneria natans (Lour.) Hara, exposed to contaminated sediments collected from five locations in Dianchi Lake, Yunnan, China. Among the sediments collected, Igeo showed enrichment of As and Cd in Dianchi Lake sediments. In spite of enriched toxic metals at some locations, laboratory bioassays found no significant difference in leaf biomass or leaf photosynthesis rate between the sites. Root biomass and root activity showed significant differences between locations and were negatively correlated with the concentration of As, Cd, Hg, and Pb in sediment but not related to Cr. The above correlations were strongest for Hg and As, respectively. Accumulation of Cd and Pb to leaves of bioassay plants was observed, but this was not evident for As and Cr. Overall, the results indicate that V. natans can be used as a bioassay organism and measures of root toxicity are sensitive to metal concentrations present in Dianchi Lake sediments. Furthermore, the study species holds promise for use as a biomonitor of Cd and Pb sediment metal content.",Chronic exposure | Metals | Risk assessment | Sediment | Toxicity | Vallisneria natans (Lour.)

Excessive nutrient loading from small agricultural headwaters can substantially degrade downstream water quality and ecological conditions. But, our understanding of the scales and locations to implement nutrient attenuation tools within these catchments is poor. To help inform farm- and catchment-scale management, we quantified nitrate export in nine one-kilometre-long lowland agricultural headwaters fed by tile and open tributary drains in a region with high groundwater nitrate (<1 to >15 mg L −1 NO 3 -N) over four years. Across-catchment differences in upstream spring water nitrate concentrations predicted differences in annual nitrate loads at catchment outlets (range <1–72 megagrams NO 3 -N 365 d −1 ), and nitrate loads were higher in wet seasons and wet years, reflecting strong groundwater influences. Partitioning the sources of variability in catchment nitrate fluxes revealed that ~60% of variation was accounted for by a combination of fluxes from up-stream springs and contributions from tile and open tributary drains (46% and 15%, respectively), with ~40% of unexplained residual variation likely due to groundwater upwellings. Although tile and open tributary drains contributed comparatively less to catchment loads (tile drains: <0.01 and up to 50 kg NO 3 -N d −1 ; open drains: <5 kg and up to 100 kg NO 3 -N d −1 ), mitigation targeted at these localised, farm-scale sources will contribute to decreasing downstream nitrate fluxes. However, high nitrate loads from groundwater mean current NO 3 -N waterway management and rehabilitation practices targeting waterway stock exclusion by fencing alone will be insufficient to reduce annual NO 3 -N export. Moreover, managing catchment nutrient fluxes will need to acknowledge contributions from groundwater as well as farm-scale losses from land. Overall, our results highlight how nutrient fluxes in spring-fed waterways can be highly dynamic, dominated more by groundwater than local run-off, and point to the scales and locations where nitrate attenuation tools should be implemented.",Agricultural land-use | Groundwater | Headwater catchments | Nitrate‑nitrogen flux | Subsurface drainage,1,0,,undefined,

In this field, a better understanding of the effects of tag burden (or the impact of an acoustic telemetry tag, which is related to the ratio of tag weight to body weight) is critical to ensure postrelease monitoring. Research on the effects of acoustic tag burden on imperiled fishes at different ontogenic stages, such as juvenile Lake Sturgeon Acipenser fulvescens, is limited. Our study provides key information for the selection of the largest acoustic tag with the greatest battery life possible (taking into account tag burden) to monitor the release success and movements of juvenile Lake Sturgeon stocked for reintroduction. We characterized tag burden effects by examining survival, TL, weight, Fulton's condition factor, and swim performance of individuals. We examined four groups of fish: control (anesthetized and no acoustic tag inserted; n = 24), sham control (anesthetized with incision sutured but no acoustic tag inserted; n = 24), Vemco V8 acoustic tag (2.0 g in air; n = 24), and Vemco V9 tag (4.4 g in air; n = 24). Acoustic tags were inserted into anesthetized fish, and the incision was sutured; tag burden (mean ± SE) ranged from 2.2 ± 0.06% to 4.6 ± 0.10% of total body weight. Results showed that the two tag burden treatments had no significant effects on growth or survival (compared to both control groups) across a 114-d study period and that critical swim speed at 12–20 d postsurgery was not significantly impacted by increasing tag burden. Because neither of the acoustic tag sizes had significant deleterious effects on the metrics studied, we recommend using a larger V9 tag (i.e., the most powerful tag with the longest battery life) for postrelease monitoring of reintroduced juvenile Lake Sturgeon.",,0,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Individual stressors can amplify (synergies) or lessen (antagonisms) each other's impacts or have fully independent effects (additive). Here we use the Laurentian Great Lakes, where a multitude of stressors have been studied for decades, as a case study for considering insights from both a systematic literature review and an expert elicitation (or structured expert judgment) to identify stressor interactions. In our literature search for pairs of stressors and interaction-related keywords, relatively few studies (9%, or 6/65) supported additive interactions with independent stressor effects. Instead, both antagonisms (42%, or 27/65) and synergies (49%, or 32/65) were common. We found substantial evidence for interactions of invasive dreissenid mussels with nutrient loading and between pairs of invasive species (predominantly dreissenids × round goby), yet both sets of records included mixtures of synergies and antagonisms. Complete quantification of individual and joint effects of stressors was rare, but effect sizes for dreissenid mussels × nutrient loading supported an antagonism. Our expert elicitation included discussion in focus groups and a follow-up survey. This process highlighted the potential for synergies of nutrient loading with dreissenid mussels and climate change as seen from the literature review. The elicitation also identified additional potential interactions less explored in the literature, particularly synergies of nutrient loading with hypoxia and wetland loss. To stimulate future research, we built a conceptual model describing interactions among dreissenid mussels, climate change, and nutrient loading. Our case study illustrates the value of considering results from both elicitations and systematic reviews to overcome data limitations. The simultaneous occurrence of synergies and antagonisms in a single ecosystem underscores the challenge of predicting the cumulative effects of stressors to guide indicator development and other management and restoration decisions.",Cumulative impact | Data synthesis | Global change | Meta-analysis | Structured expert judgment | Systematic review,1,0,U-M,undefined,University of Michigan

Despite much attention, the question of how this key cognitive trait has evolved remains unanswered. The motor theory for the origin of vocal learning posits that neural centres specialized for vocal learning arose from adjacent areas in the brain devoted to general motor learning. One prediction of this hypothesis is that visual displays that rely on complex motor patterns may also be learned in taxa with vocal learning. While learning of both spoken and gestural languages is well documented in humans, the occurrence of learned visual displays has rarely been examined in non-human animals. We tested for geographical variation consistent with learning of visual displays in long-billed hermits (Phaethornis longirostris), a lek-mating hummingbird that, like humans, has both learned vocalizations and elaborate visual displays. We found lek-level signatures in both vocal parameters and visual display features, including display element proportions, sequence syntax and fine-scale parameters of elements. This variation was not associated with genetic differentiation between leks. In the absence of genetic differences, geographical variation in vocal signals at small scales is most parsimoniously attributed to learning, suggesting a significant role of social learning in visual display ontogeny. The co-occurrence of learning in vocal and visual displays would be consistent with a parallel evolution of these two signal modalities in this species.",Geographical variation | Hummingbirds | Lek mating system | Motor theory for vocal learning | Visual displays | Vocal learning,0,0,,9169-12,National Geographic Society

In British Columbia, Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) are the top finfish aquaculture export of the province, although native Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) are also farmed locally. Few commercial facilities rear Chinook salmon, limiting the availability and development of their broodstocks, potentially reducing the ability to improve product quantity and quality. Due to the potential for inbreeding in these stocks, a need to determine whether product quantity and quality can be improved through outbreeding with wild populations exists. In this study, we examined the effects of outbreeding on farmed salmon by comparing product quantity and quality metrics in six experimental populations of outbred (wild × farmed) Chinook salmon and one farmed (control) population. Specifically, we measured fillet yield, slaughter yield, lipid content and flesh colour score in three-year old market-sized salmon immediately post-slaughter. We found significant differences across populations for slaughter yield, fillet yield and flesh colour score but found no differences across populations in lipid content. For flesh colour score, slaughter and fillet yield, the control farmed population performed similarly to the highest performing outbred populations. These results suggest that outbreeding inbred farmed populations with wild populations can maintain high product quality while adding new genes to a population.",Farmed | Multiple populations | Outbreeding | Quality | Wild,0,0,,240909549,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Standardized time-series for temperature and total phosphorus (TP), chlorophyll-a, phytoplankton density (cel m-3), and cell size (μm3), as well as zooplankton structure (Copepoda, Cladocera, and Rotifera density, ind m-3) were smoothed using penalized B-splines and analyzed using Functional Principal Components (FPCs) to assess their dominant modes of variation.

Results showed that temperature fluctuated during the study period, particularly during 1988-1992 with a general tendency to increase. TP showed a declining trend with some reversions in the pattern observed in the years 1992, 1999, and 2000. Phytoplankton estimators and chlorophyll-a concentration showed a variable trend along the study period. Zooplankton groups also had a variable trend along the study period with a general increase in density of large carnivorous (mainly Bythotrephes longimanus) and a decrease of large herbivorous (mainly Daphnia), and a similar increase in the ratio of raptorial to microphagous rotifers.

To test the hypothesis of dietary resource partitioning between batoids within a communal nursery, we investigated two cownose ray species, Rhinoptera bonasus and R. brasiliensis, which occur in heterospecific groups, a strategy predicted to increase survival and foraging success. Using two biochemical tracers, fatty acids (FA) and stable isotopes (δ 15 N and δ 13 C), the combined effects of maternal investment and the formation of heterospecific groups implying competition for, or partitioning of available food resources were investigated. Through univariate and multivariate analyses of biochemical tracers in several tissues (fin clip, muscle, liver, red blood cells; RBC) and plasma, our results revealed significant interspecific differences in tracers between the two species. Total FAs (∑saturated FA, ∑monounsaturated FA and ∑polyunsaturated FA) and trophic biomarkers (i.e., docosahexaenoic acid, arachidonic acid, oleic acid and δ 15 N) were the principle tracers responsible for the differences detected. These data revealed that R. brasiliensis was less enriched in physiologically important essential FAs than R. bonasus. Our findings suggest that these congeneric species differ in maternal investment strategy and moderately partition food resources over relatively fine spatial scales within a single nursery habitat to limit competition. These results provide further knowledge on the foraging strategies adopted by batoids in communal nursery areas, information that is required for improving spatial conservation and management planning.",elasmobranch | fatty acids | life history strategy | maternal investment | stable isotopes | trophic ecology,0,0,FAPESP,2014/16320–7,Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Estado de São Paulo

Based on the observations for the Great Lakes in the context of risk to human health from eating fish, it is concluded that comprehensive monitoring of dioxins/furans can be replaced with targeted locations and/or indicator species, and the saved resources can be more efficiently utilized for monitoring of other priority or emerging contaminants.",Advisories | Dioxins/furans/dioxin like PCB | Fish consumption | Great lakes | Health risk | Spatial and temporal trends,0,0,,undefined,Government of Ontario

The present study highlights the importance of incorporating nonsedimentary routes of exposure into a nonequilibrium, steady-state food web bioaccumulation model for predicting polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) concentrations in benthic invertebrates. Specifically, we examined the proportion of overlying water relative to the sediment porewater respired by benthic invertebrates, which has been used in previous studies to examine contaminant bioaccumulation. We evaluated the model accuracy using paired benthos–sediment samples and an extensive fish contamination database to ensure realistic predictions at the base of the Detroit River (Ontario, Canada, and Michigan, USA) food web. The results demonstrate that, compared with empirical regression analyses, the food web bioaccumulation model provided satisfactory estimates of PCB bioaccumulation for benthos simulations and better estimates for fish simulations. Our results showed that PCB bioaccumulation measurements are significantly affected by variations in pollutant uptake and elimination routes via the overlying water, which in turn are affected by the degree of disequilibrium of PCBs between sediments and water. Interestingly, we obtained contrasting results regarding the effectiveness of remediation strategies for reducing the contaminant burden of the aquatic biota based on different proportions of overlying water relative to porewater. These differences could consequently impact decisions about the approaches for source control and strategic sediment remediation. This study suggests that bioaccumulation assessments could be improved through better identification of chemical uptake–elimination routes in benthos and by accounting for chemical bioavailability in sediment and water components in areas with disequilibrium.Integr Environ Assess Manag 2019;00:000–000. © 2019 SETAC.",Area of concern | Benthic invertebrates | Bioaccumulation model | Persistent organic pollutants,0,0,,undefined,

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Population genetics has been increasingly applied to study large sharks over the last decade. Whilst large shark species are often difficult to study with direct methods, improved knowledge is needed for both population management and conservation, especially for species vulnerable to anthropogenic and climatic impacts. The tiger shark, Galeocerdo cuvier, is an apex predator known to play important direct and indirect roles in tropical and subtropical marine ecosystems. While the global and Indo-West Pacific population genetic structure of this species has recently been investigated, questions remain over population structure and demographic history within the western Indian (WIO) and within the western Pacific Oceans (WPO). To address the knowledge gap in tiger shark regional population structures, the genetic diversity of 286 individuals sampled in seven localities was investigated using 27 microsatellite loci and three mitochondrial genes (CR, COI, and cytb). A weak genetic differentiation was observed between the WIO and the WPO, suggesting high genetic connectivity. This result agrees with previous studies and highlights the importance of the pelagic behavior of this species to ensure gene flow. Using approximate Bayesian computation to couple information from both nuclear and mitochondrial markers, evidence of a recent bottleneck in the Holocene (2,000–3,000 years ago) was found, which is the most probable cause for the low genetic diversity observed. A contemporary effective population size as low as 111 [43,369] was estimated during the bottleneck. Together, these results indicate low genetic diversity that may reflect a vulnerable population sensitive to regional pressures. Conservation measures are thus needed to protect a species that is classified as Near Threatened.",approximate Bayesian computation | bottleneck | effective population size | microsatellite DNA | mitochondrial DNA | tiger shark,1,1,,1504‐004,Agropolis Fondation

Global Change Biology Published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd Climate change and human pressures are changing the global distribution and the extent of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES), which comprise half of the global river network area. IRES are characterized by periods of flow cessation, during which channel substrates accumulate and undergo physico-chemical changes (preconditioning), and periods of flow resumption, when these substrates are rewetted and release pulses of dissolved nutrients and organic matter (OM). However, there are no estimates of the amounts and quality of leached substances, nor is there information on the underlying environmental constraints operating at the global scale. We experimentally simulated, under standard laboratory conditions, rewetting of leaves, riverbed sediments, and epilithic biofilms collected during the dry phase across 205 IRES from five major climate zones. We determined the amounts and qualitative characteristics of the leached nutrients and OM, and estimated their areal fluxes from riverbeds. In addition, we evaluated the variance in leachate characteristics in relation to selected environmental variables and substrate characteristics. We found that sediments, due to their large quantities within riverbeds, contribute most to the overall flux of dissolved substances during rewetting events (56%–98%), and that flux rates distinctly differ among climate zones. Dissolved organic carbon, phenolics, and nitrate contributed most to the areal fluxes. The largest amounts of leached substances were found in the continental climate zone, coinciding with the lowest potential bioavailability of the leached OM. The opposite pattern was found in the arid zone. Environmental variables expected to be modified under climate change (i.e. potential evapotranspiration, aridity, dry period duration, land use) were correlated with the amount of leached substances, with the strongest relationship found for sediments. These results show that the role of IRES should be accounted for in global biogeochemical cycles, especially because prevalence of IRES will increase due to increasing severity of drying events.",biofilms | leaching | leaf litter | rewetting | sediments | temporary rivers,3,1,NRC,SU 405/10‐1,National Research Council

The number of released individuals, which is a component of propagule pressure, is considered to be a major driver for the establishment success of non-native species. However, propagule pressure is often assumed to result from single or few release events, which does not necessarily apply to the frequent releases of invertebrates or other taxa through global transport. For instance, the high intensity of global shipping may result in frequent releases of large numbers of individuals, and the complexity of shipping dynamics impedes predictions of invasion dynamics. Here, we present a mathematical model for the spread of planktonic organisms by global shipping, using the history of movements by 33 566 ships among 1477 ports to simulate population dynamics for the comb jelly Mnemiopsis leidyi as a case study. The degree of propagule pressure at one site resulted from the coincident arrival of individuals from other sites with native or non-native populations. Key to sequential spread in European waters was a readily available source of propagules and a suitable recipient environment. These propagules were derived from previously introduced 'bridgehead' populations supplemented with those from native sources. Invasion success is therefore determined by the complex interaction of global shipping and local population dynamics. The general findings probably hold true for the spread of species in other complex systems, such as insects or plant seeds exchanged via commercial trade or transport.",ballast water release | global shipping | invasive species | metapopulation | modelling | propagule pressure,1,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Biosecurity protocols designed to prevent invader spread have become integral to invasive species management strategies. However, application of many proposed spread-prevention practices is inhibited due to low practicality, high expense, undesirable non-target effects and a lack of known efficacy. Here, we examine the use of direct steam exposure to induce substantial fragment (i.e. propagule stage) degradation of seven invasive macrophytes: Ceratophyllum demersum, Crassula helmsii, Egeria densa, Elodea canadensis, Elodea nuttallii, Lagarosiphon major and Potamogeton crispus. Each species was independently exposed to steam treatments in loose clumps of three fragments, steamed at a distance of 2–3 cm from the source, for varied exposure times: 10 s, 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, and 5 min. Furthermore, we develop and apply a novel degradation scale describing visual tissue biodegradation stages and/or resumption of growth for fragmentary propagules. Steam treatments were observed to be highly efficacious, with total degradation being induced by 10 s of direct steam exposure. This was apparent for all species following a seven day recovery period, except C. demersum, which took until 21 days.

Excessive macrophytes can cause significant problems in agricultural waterways requiring active management. Conventional control techniques can have a range of adverse effects. We investigated several control tools in two experiments: firstly, we tested eight treatments at a small-scale (2 m × 2 m). We found intensive hand weeding, weed mat and herbicide spraying to be effective treatments, reducing macrophyte cover to <5%. Hand weeding and weed mat immediately reduced cover, while dieback from herbicide took two months. Weed mat was a novel and effective control mechanism along stream banks. Secondly, we tested the impact of shading on macrophyte growth. Macrophyte growth was enhanced under partially shaded conditions, but with 80% effective shading over the entire channel, cover was reduced to 17%. Once treatments ceased, macrophytes grew back within 3–5 months. Long-term, control methods will require combinations of tools but will need to include optimal shading for the target species.",agricultural drains | agricultural waterways | aquatic weeds | Erythranthe guttata | Macrophyte control | Nasturtium microphyllum | plant management,1,0,,undefined,

Sustained neurotransmission requires the tight coupling of synaptic vesicle (SV) exocytosis and endocytosis. The mechanisms underlying this coupling are poorly understood. We tested the hypothesis that a CNS/PNS-dependent protein kinase (PKG), encoded by the foraging (for) gene in Drosophila melanogaster, is critical for this process using a for null mutant, genomic rescues and tissue-specific rescues. We uncoupled the exocytic and endocytic functions of FOR in neurotransmission using a temperature-sensitive shibire mutant in conjunction with fluorescein-assisted light inactivation of FOR. We discovered a dual role for presynaptic FOR, in which FOR inhibits SV exocytosis during low-frequency stimulation by negatively regulating presynaptic Ca2+ levels and maintains neurotransmission during highfrequency stimulation by facilitating SV endocytosis. Additionally, glial FOR negatively regulated nerve terminal growth through TGF-β signalling, and this developmental effect was independent of the effects of FOR on neurotransmission. Overall, FOR plays a critical role in coupling SV exocytosis and endocytosis, thereby balancing these two components to maintain sustained neurotransmission.",Endocytosis | Exocytosis | Neurotransmitter release | Presynaptic | Synaptic transmission,0,1,,RGPIN 3397-11,Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada

However, persistent technological and logistical challenges have thus far impeded the implementation of biotelemetry in the deep sea. Despite these limitations, innovations in telemetry technology, experimental design, and animal handling have allowed the study of 13 families of deep-water fishes to date, providing movement records spanning from surface waters down to 5900 m depth and across nearly all of the world's oceans. Telemetry devices employed in deep-sea tracking studies have included both commercially available and custom-built transmitters belonging to multiple tag categories: acoustic transponders/code-activated acoustic transponders, acoustic transmitters (coded and continuous, e.g., ‘pingers’), pop-up satellite archival tags, and archival tags (data loggers). Specially adapted tagging approaches, including in situ methods such as dart tagging via manned submersible, underwater surgical implantation, and the ingestion of baited transmitters have facilitated the monitoring of species that can not survive being brought to the surface, while modified capture, tag, and release approaches have been used for species that can withstand depressurization. These tracking data have revealed patterns in the vertical and horizontal movement behaviours and population connectivity of a number of data deficient species, as well as contributing to management by allowing the effectiveness of reserves, fisheries management boundaries, and fishery closures to be evaluated. With the rapid expansion of fisheries and natural resource exploration to depths beyond the continental shelf, further monitoring of deep-sea habitats and species is essential. By examining these substantial breakthroughs in biotelemetry application, in addition to the range of cutting-edge technologies that could be adapted for use in deep water, we strive to promote the timely advancement of this research in the deep sea. Further diversification of these tools and techniques will be necessary to expand the accessibility of this field to the broader scientific community.",Animal tracking | Deep-water | Movement ecology | Spatial ecology | Telemetry,0,0,,undefined,

Population-level phenotypic variation has been attributed to genetic differences resulting from genetic drift and/or local adaptation as well as environmental differences resulting from plasticity. We studied population- and family-level variation in gene transcription for 22 fitness-related genes, comprising immune, growth, metabolic, and stress processes in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We created hybrid Chinook salmon families from eight populations and treated them with an immune stimulus, a handling stress challenge, and held some as a no-treatment control group. Population effects, sire effects, and narrow-sense heritability (h2) were calculated for each candidate gene within each treatment group. We expected population to have a significant effect on gene transcription for many of our genes; however, we found a population effect for transcription at only one immune gene at rest. The limited number of significant population effects on gene transcription, combined with significant additive genetic variance within each population does not support the expectation of past strong selection pressures acting on heritable transcription profiles among populations. Instead, our results indicate that Chinook salmon likely adapt to their local environment through transcriptional plasticity rather than fixed differences. The expectation for fixed population-level differences in gene transcription at fitness-related genes, reflecting accepted models of local adaptation is high; however, comparisons among multiple populations using half-sibling breeding designs are rare.

Olfaction mediates behaviors necessary for survival and reproduction in fishes. Anthropogenic inputs of contaminants into aquatic environments, specifically copper, are known to disrupt a broad range of olfactory-mediated behaviors and can cause long-lasting damage even at low concentrations that have profound impacts on the biology of aquatic organisms. The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is a primitive fish species invasive to the North American Great Lakes that relies on olfaction to navigate during natal homing and in mate choice during reproduction. To investigate effects of copper on sea lamprey olfaction and the potential for maintenance of olfactory function during copper exposure, we exposed juvenile sea lamprey to environmentally ecologically relevant copper concentrations (0, 5, 10 and 30 mg/L) for 24 hr and characterized gene transcription response in olfactory tissue (i.e., peripheral olfactory organ and olfactory bulb) and forebrain using whole transcriptome sequencing. Copper exposure induced a pattern of positive dose-dependent transcriptional response. Expression changes primarily reflected up-regulation of genes involved in apoptosis and wound healing. Unlike higher vertebrates, genes specifically related to the olfactory senses of the sea lamprey, e.g., olfactory receptors, exhibited little transcriptional response to copper exposure, suggesting the mechanism of copper-induced olfactory impairment is through necrosis of the olfactory bulb and not copper-selective inhibition of olfactory receptors. Fully two-thirds of the differentially expressed genes at higher doses of copper have no known function and thus represent important candidates for further study of the responses to copper-induced olfactory injury. Our results shed light on the evolution of vertebrate olfactory repair mechanisms and have important implications for the conservation and management of both invasive and native populations of lamprey.",Brain transcriptome | Copper | Olfaction | Petromyzon marinus | Sea lamprey,0,1,,03916,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Aquatic invasive species (AIS) continue to adversely influence freshwater ecosystems worldwide. Management protocols designed to prevent further invader spread are essential, as control and eradication of established AIS populations are often complex, costly, resource-intensive, and can be relatively ineffective. Therefore, in-field biosecurity techniques designed to deliver effective decontamination of water users’ equipment, e.g. angler's nets, footwear, and kayaks, are needed. Disinfection through brief submergence in chemical solutions may be beneficial. Although broad-spectrum, aquatic disinfectants have been recommended as suitable biosecurity agents, the ability of these chemicals to inhibit invader spread remains poorly understood. Here, we examined the effectiveness of two aquatic disinfectants, Virasure® Aquatic and Virkon® Aquatic, to reduce growth rates, induce biodegradation, and decrease shoot and root production at the fragmentary propagule stage of the prolific invasive macrophyte, Elodea nuttallii (Planchon) H. St. John, 1920. We examined the efficacy of both chemicals at submergence times of one, two and five minutes, using 0% (0 g L−1), 1% (10 g L−1) and 4% (40 g L−1) disinfectant solutions. Both apical and mid-stem fragmentary sections were examined separately. A biodegradation scale was applied to visually assess tissue degradation and/or resumption of growth. Although E. nuttallii displayed substantial and sustained degradation after all disinfection treatments, all fragments demonstrated viability through resumption of shoot or root growth over the observation period. Therefore, at the examined concentrations and exposure times, it appears that these broad-spectrum aquatic disinfectants are not capable of curtailing the spread of invasive E. nuttallii. However, longer submergence times, multiple applications and synergistic effects of different biosecurity treatments could potentially prevent further E. nuttallii spread and this requires investigation.",Biosecurity | Fragment degradation | Invasive species management | Secondary dispersal | Spread-prevention | Virasure  Aquatic ® | Virkon  Aquatic ®,2,0,,2015-NC-MS-4,Natural Environment Research Council

Economic development is increasing leading to more disturbances and pressures on Arctic wildlife. Identifying areas that support higher levels of predator abundance and biodiversity is important for the implementation of targeted conservation measures across the Arctic. Location: Primarily Canadian Arctic marine waters but also parts of the United States, Greenland and Russia. Methods: We compiled the largest data set of existing telemetry data for marine predators in the North American Arctic consisting of 1,283 individuals from 21 species. Data were arranged into four species groups: (a) cetaceans and pinnipeds, (b) polar bears Ursus maritimus (c) seabirds, and (d) fishes to address the following objectives: (a) to identify abundance hotspots for each species group in the summer–autumn and winter–spring; (b) to identify species diversity hotspots across all species groups and extent of overlap with exclusive economic zones; and (c) to perform a gap analysis that assesses amount of overlap between species diversity hotspots with existing protected areas. Results: Abundance and species diversity hotpots during summer–autumn and winter–spring were identified in Baffin Bay, Davis Strait, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Amundsen Gulf, and the Beaufort, Chukchi and Bering seas both within and across species groups. Abundance and species diversity hotpots occurred within the continental slope in summer–autumn and offshore in areas of moving pack ice in winter–spring. Gap analysis revealed that the current level of conservation protection that overlaps species diversity hotspots is low covering only 5% (77,498 km 2 ) in summer–autumn and 7% (83,202 km 2 ) in winter–spring. Main conclusions: We identified several areas of potential importance for Arctic marine predators that could provide policymakers with a starting point for conservation measures given the multitude of threats facing the Arctic. These results are relevant to multilevel and multinational governance to protect this vulnerable ecosystem in our rapidly changing world.",animal movement | biologging | climate change | conservation | fishes | marine mammals | protected areas | seabirds,0,0,,273061,Nunavut Wildlife Research Trust

Making optimal oviposition decisions is especially important for female carrion colonizing insects whose larvae often depend on ephemeral resources. Optimal oviposition theory predicts that females should exhibit behaviors that will maximize the performance of their offspring. Oviposition can be influenced by a variety of factors, including temperature. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of temperature on the oviposition behavior and egg load of two blow fly species native to southern Ontario: Phormia regina Meigen, and Lucilia sericata Meigen (Diptera: Calliphoridae). Using fetal pig carcasses as an oviposition substrate, we assessed the length of time until the first oviposition event, preferred oviposition sites, and the total number of eggs oviposited. For each of the two species, five different temperature treatments ranging from 15 to 35°C were used. Temperature influenced time to the first oviposition event, as well as the number of eggs deposited by L. sericata and P. regina. As temperature increased, oviposition occurred faster with more eggs deposited for these two species. Female P. regina, in particular, demonstrated a higher egg load with increasing temperature. Differences in optimal temperatures for reproduction, including egg load and oviposition, may be a mechanism driving seasonal temporal resource partitioning leading to species coexistence utilizing ephemeral resources.",abiotic factors | coexistence | colonization | females | site selection,0,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

Recent advances in invasion research has highlighted that differences in the feeding ecology of native and non-native species manifest through differences in their functional responses (FRs) and that FRs track ecological impact. Further, as with plant competition studies, differential resource use patterns may illuminate competition mechanisms among animal taxa. Ladybirds are a diverse family of beetles that possess substantial variation in body mass across taxa. Further, some ladybird species have been widely introduced into novel habitats, where they may pose significant risks of ecological and economic harm. By controlling for allometric scaling, we tested the hypothesis that introduced Asian multicoloured ladybirds (Harmonia axyridis) are more efficient predators on aphids than trophically-analogous, native convergent ladybirds (Hippodamia convergens). We utilized a prey-replacement FR design, and assessed rates of pea aphid consumption as a function of initial prey density. H. axyridis possessed significantly higher absolute and mass-adjusted FRs (Type II) than the native species, consistent with expectations. The higher FR was mediated by reduced handling time, suggesting that the ability of H. axyridis to manipulate and digest prey exceeds that of H. convergens. Our feeding results may explain, in part, the increasing occurrence and abundance of the introduced species, and documented declines of native species of prey and competitor in invaded habitats.",Functional response | Invasion | Limiting similarity | Niche | Non-indigenous species | Sympatry,0,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Among songbirds, the maintenance of lipid reserves is a widely-used strategy to cope with the severity of winter; however, little is known regarding how multiple synchronously acting environmental mechanisms work together to drive these effects. In a context where temperate winter conditions are becoming more variable, it is important to widen our understanding regarding the flexible adaptations that may allow wintering species to adjust to projected climate change. Using a long-term dataset collected across multiple wintering populations (7 years; 8 locations), we analyzed the effects of daily variation in weather (e.g. temperature, snowfall) on the variation in energy reserves (i.e. fat stores) of wintering snow buntings Plectrophenax nivalis. Our results support the prediction that birds carry more reserves to increase the safety margin against starvation when conditions are energy-demanding and access to food is unpredictable (i.e. colder, snowier conditions). Birds responded to daily changes in weather by increasing their reserves as conditions deteriorated, with maximal temperatures and snow depth being the most important predictors of fattening decisions. We also found that females consistently exhibited higher fat reserves than males relative to their body size, suggesting that differential physiological adaptations among sexes or social dominance may play an additional role in explaining variation in energy reserves across individuals in this species. Overall, our findings increase knowledge on phenotypic adjustments used by species wintering in temperate zones to match variation in their environment.",avian energetics | snow bunting | winter acclimatization,1,0,,undefined,Fonds de Recherche du Québec - Nature et Technologies

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. To invest in energetically demanding life history stages, individuals require a substantial amount of resources. Physiological traits, particularly those related to energetics, can be useful for examining variation in life history decisions and trade-offs because they result from individual responses to environmental variation. Leptin is a protein hormone found in mammals that is proportional to the amount of endogenous fat stores within an individual. Recently, researchers have confirmed that a mammalian leptin analogue (MLA), based on the mammalian sequence of leptin, is present with associated receptors and proteins in avian species, with an inhibitory effect on foraging and body mass gain at high circulating levels. While MLA has been both quantified and manipulated in avian species, little is currently known regarding whether plasma MLA in wild-living species and individuals is associated with key reproductive decisions. We quantified plasma MLA in wild, Arctic-nesting female common eiders (Somateria mollissima) at arrival on the breeding grounds and followed them to determine subsequent breeding propensity, and reproductive phenology, investment, and success. Common eiders are capital-income breeding birds that require the accumulation of substantial fat stores to initiate laying and successfully complete incubation. We found that females with lower plasma MLA initiated breeding earlier and in a shorter period of time. However, we found no links between plasma MLA levels and breeding propensity, clutch size, or reproductive success. Although little is still known about plasma MLA, based on these results and its role in influencing foraging behaviors and condition gain, plasma MLA appears to be closely linked to reproductive timing and is therefore likely to underlie trade-offs surrounding life history decisions.",clutch size | common eider | energetic demand | leptin | plasma mammalian leptin analogue | reproductive phenology | reproductive success,1,1,,undefined,Environment and Climate Change Canada

Printed in Great Britain Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is overexpressed in most prostate adenocarcinoma (AdPC) cells and acts as a target for molecular imaging. However, some case reports indicate that PSMA-targeted imaging could be ineffectual for delineation of neuroendocrine (NE) prostate cancer (NEPC) lesions due to the suppression of the PSMA gene (FOLH1). These same reports suggest that targeting somatostatin receptor type 2 (SSTR2) could be an alternative diagnostic target for NEPC patients. This study evaluates the correlation between expression of FOLH1, NEPC marker genes and SSTR2. We evaluated the transcript abundance for FOLH1 and SSTR2 genes as well as NE markers across 909 tumors. A significant suppression of FOLH1 in NEPC patient samples and AdPC samples with high expression of NE marker genes was observed. We also investigated protein alterations of PSMA and SSTR2 in an NE-induced cell line derived by hormone depletion and lineage plasticity by loss of p53. PSMA is suppressed following NE induction and cellular plasticity in p53-deficient NEPC model. The PSMA-suppressed cells have more colony formation ability and resistance to enzalutamide treatment. Conversely, SSTR2 was only elevated following hormone depletion. In 18 NEPC patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models we find a significant suppression of FOLH1 and amplification of SSTR2 expression. Due to the observed FOLH1-supressed signature of NEPC, this study cautions on the reliability of using PMSA as a target for molecular imaging of NEPC. The observed elevation of SSTR2 in NEPC supports the possible ability of SSTR2-targeted imaging for follow-up imaging of low PSMA patients and monitoring for NEPC development.",Neuroendocrine differentiation | Nuclear medicine | Prostate cancer | PSMA | Somatostatin receptor,3,0,,H 阀14C1072,

Different components of learned birdsongs change at different rates across generations, and the rate of change may correspond to the information carried by each component. To characterize the role of the buzz segment of Savannah sparrow songs, we examined recordings from southeastern Canada and the northeastern US and fully characterized buzz segments in songs recorded from two populations: one on Kent Island, NB, Canada and another in Williamstown, MA, USA. Buzzes varied geographically: Kent Island buzzes had higher mean frequencies and shorter pulse periods than Williamstown buzzes and the differences between the two populations persisted over time. Population-specific buzz characteristics also appeared to be resistant to change. Variants appeared on Kent Island in the late 1980s and were learned by some younger birds; however, these buzz variants disappeared by 2011. We conducted a playback experiment and found that males from both populations had longer responses to local buzzes. Therefore, buzz structure varies geographically; population characteristics of the buzz persist through time despite the introduction of variant forms; and territorial males discriminate between buzzes from different populations. The learned buzz segment of the song may thus serve as a population marker for Savannah sparrows.",Cultural evolution | Dialect | Passerculus sandwichensis | Playback | Population | Song,0,0,,0816132,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Eutrophication of freshwater ecosystems and harmful algal blooms (HABs) are an ongoing concern affecting water quality in the Great Lakes watershed of North America. Despite binational management efforts, Lake Erie has been at the center of dissolved reactive phosphate driven eutrophication research due to its repeated cycles of algae blooms. We investigated the Detroit River, the largest source of water entering Lake Erie, with the objectives to (1) characterize Detroit River phosphate levels within water and sediment, and (2) use multiple chemical and isotopic tracers to identify nutrient sources in the Detroit River. Riverine water and sediment samples were collected at 23 locations across 8 transects of the Detroit River. The bulk δ15N values from sediments were enriched compared the δ15N values of nitrate from water samples, consistent with biogeochemical cycling in the sediment. Principle component analysis of multiple chemical tracers from water samples found spatial variation consistent with multiple sources including synthetic and manure-derived fertilizers and wastewater effluent. The concentrations of phosphate dissolved in water were within regulatory guidelines; however, sediments had elevated concentrations of both water- and acid-extractable phosphate. Sediment-sequestered legacy phosphorus historically deposited in the Detroit River may be transported into Lake Erie and, if mobilized into the water column, be an unrecognized internal-load that contributes to algal bloom events. Globally, freshwater ecosystems are impacted by numerous non-point source phosphorus inputs contributing to eutrophication and the use of multiple tracer approaches will increase our ability to effectively manage aquatic ecosystems.",Anthropogenic impacts | Bioavailable | Detroit River | Isotopic tracers | Mineralized | Phosphorus,5,0,,undefined,Adam Taliaferro Foundation

We performed experiments on the black bullhead (Ameiurus melas), a species with known hearing specializations and located within the Laurentian Great Lakes where there is considerable commercial and recreational boat traffic. We tested and compared physiology (baseline cortisol), behaviour (activity, sheltering), and morphology (ciliary bundles of hair cells) of bullhead to boat noise. At 140 dB re 1 μPa (−54.84 dB re 1 m·s−2), we saw clear behavioural effects in terms of both activity and sheltering levels despite no obvious morphological or physiological stress. Following both short-and long-period acute exposure to higher — but environmentally relevant — noise levels, bullhead were less active and sheltered more and also exhibited a decrease in ciliary bundles. These results suggest that there are sublethal effects of anthropogenic noise on fish behaviour and ciliary bundles, which may have direct implications on population health. Moreover, commonly used metrics such as stress hormones may not always offer the most relevant biomarker of the response to anthropogenic boat noise.",,0,0,NSERC,undefined,Canada Research Chairs

The production of high quality secondary sexual traits can be constrained by trade-offs in the allocation of energy and nutrients with other metabolic activities, and is mediated by physiological processes. In birds, the factors influencing male plumage quality have been well studied; however, factors affecting female plumage quality are poorly understood. Furthermore, it remains uncertain which physiological traits mediate the relationship between body condition and ornaments. In this three-year study of after-second-year female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), we investigated (1) the relationship between baseline corticosterone near the end of the brood-rearing period (CORTBR) and feather colour characteristics (hue, saturation, brightness) the following year, and (2) the relationship between baseline corticosterone measured during incubation (CORTI) and brood rearing (CORTBR), and feather colour in the same year. To control for reproductive effort, we included reproductive parameters as covariates in all analyses. In this first study between CORT and the plumage colour characteristics of a species bearing iridescent feathers, we did not find any relationship between CORTBR and the colour of subsequently-produced feathers, nor did we find any relationship between CORT and the colour of feathers displayed during that breeding season. If CORT levels at the end of breeding carry over to influence the immediately subsequent moult period as we expect, our results generally indicate that structural plumage quality may not be as sensitive to circulating CORT levels compared to carotenoid-based colouration. Future studies, particularly those employing experimental manipulations of CORT during moult in species with iridescent traits, are necessary to fully determine the role glucocorticoids play in mediating the quality of secondary sexual characteristics.",Corticosterone | Glucocorticoid | Honest signals | Iridescence | Mate choice | Reproduction | Secondary sexual characteristics,0,0,,undefined,Government of Ontario

Passive acoustic monitoring (PAM) can be a powerful tool to survey populations of soniferous species in natural settings. Using PAM allows monitoring of behaviour and activity unobtrusively to get a more accurate assessment of behavioural responses than traditional techniques. The use of PAM can also be beneficial for behaviourally cryptic species or other taxa that might be missed by more traditional sampling methods. To quantify seasonality of reproduction in an aquatic invasive species and to assess possible interactions between both abiotic and biotic noise and acoustic ecology, we deployed multiple hydrophones to fully characterise the acoustic behaviour of round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), a highly invasive species. We also aimed to quantify levels of anthropogenic noise around the goby communities. We tested correlations of round goby calling rates with overall noise levels and the presence of boat traffic as direct tests of the hypothesised role of noise on natural acoustic behaviour of fish. Round goby showed a clear diel patterning of calling behaviour, with the highest activity during the night and ceasing at midday; supporting the importance of acoustic—as opposed to visual—signalling for mate attraction. Calls also allowed us to pinpoint spawning areas for possible remediation. We saw no correlation between measures of background noise and calling behaviour or presence of boats and calling, suggesting that increased levels of noise have no effect on the natural calling behaviour of this species. Passive acoustic monitoring of round goby calling behaviour is a promising technique for those interested in remediation of this highly invasive species, as it can be difficult to quantify population levels by more conventional means. The lack of noise effects we see suggests that noise from recreational boats does not disrupt signalling in this species with limited hearing range, although more investigation is needed to ascertain whether noise could be a stressor in other contexts.",anthropogenic noise | fish acoustic | invasive species | passive acoustic | reproduction,0,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Flight calls, the quiet calls emitted by migratory birds on the wing, offer opportunities to understand the behaviour of birds during migration. We test the effectiveness of an eight-element microphone array for three-dimensional triangulation of the position of calling migratory birds. We constructed a microphone array out of commercially available components and used freely available software to process the recordings, so that this technology might be easily adopted for migration monitoring. In the Great Lakes region of North America, we triangulated the position of loudspeakers broadcasting synthetic tones and flight calls, as well as calls of actual passing migrants. Loudspeakers broadcasting synthetic tones showed a triangulation accuracy of 1.52 ± 0.34 m. Loudspeakers broadcasting flight calls of migratory wood-warblers showed a triangulation accuracy of 2.04 ± 0.37 m. Actual migratory warblers passing over the microphone array showed an estimated accuracy of 2.70 ± 0.48 m. We conclude that wireless microphone arrays accurately triangulate migrant birds, at least under optimal recording conditions. We present this proof-of-concept study to demonstrate the reliability of this underutilized technique which should be of interest as a tool for studying migratory bird behaviour, for quantifying migratory bird populations, and for monitoring the conservation of migratory birds.",Flight calls | migration | parulidae | triangulation | wireless microphone array,0,0,,undefined,

One of the biggest challenges for such studies is the isolation of environmental DNA (eDNA) from a variety of samples, diverse microbes, and widely variable community compositions. The current study developed environmentally friendly, user safe, economical, and high throughput eDNA extraction methods for mixed aquatic microbial communities and tested them using 16 s rRNA gene meta-barcoding. Five different lysis buffers including (1) cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), (2) digestion buffer (DB), (3) guanidinium isothiocyanate (GITC), (4) sucrose lysis (SL), and (5) SL-CTAB, coupled with four different purification methods: (1) phenol-chloroform-isoamyl alcohol (PCI), (2) magnetic Bead-Robotic, (3) magnetic Bead-Manual, and (4) membrane-filtration were tested for their efficacy in extracting eDNA from recreational freshwater samples. Results indicated that the CTAB-PCI and SL-Bead-Robotic methods yielded the highest genomic eDNA concentrations and succeeded in detecting the core microbial community including the rare microbes.

Hearing ability is well studied across teleost fishes in general, and vertebrates more broadly, but little is known about sound detection abilities of lampreys (Petromyzontiformes), a basal extant vertebrate group. The sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) is a destructive invader of the Laurentian Great Lakes, while numerous lamprey species (including the sea lamprey) are imperiled in their native ranges. In both management scenarios, behavioral manipulation tactics to control movement and distribution are desired. Therefore, we describe the hearing ability and behavioral responses of adult and juvenile sea lamprey to sound to reveal how hearing may have evolved in vertebrates and determine possible management applications. Based on auditory evoked potentials, sea lamprey detected tones of 50–300 Hz with equal sensitivity, but did not detect sounds above 300 Hz. In a laboratory bioassay, sea lamprey behaviorally responded to sound range of 50–200 Hz, with a general increase in swimming and a decrease in resting behaviours at both juvenile and adult stages relative to no-sound controls. To our knowledge, this is the first test of lamprey hearing, and the results support that sound may be a means to modify lamprey behaviour for management purposes.",,0,0,GLFC,undefined,Great Lakes Fishery Commission

Media reach is now global and rapid, particularly through western news outlets and amplified by social networks. This has consequences for how the public perceive human-predator conflicts and in turn how this impacts species' conservation and management. To address this point, a literature search was undertaken to synthesize global records of predator-human conflicts followed be an assessment of media reporting of conflicts, for both aquatic (sharks) and terrestrial (lion, tiger, leopard, cougar, puma, bear spp.) species. We show that predator-human conflicts involving terrestrial mammals occur predominantly in developing"" nations (>90%) while aquatic predator-human conflicts occur (65%) and are principally reported from developed nations. Moreover, media reporting of sharks is dominated by attacks on humans and sensationalized documentation of incidences compared to those involving terrestrial species. As a result, high media coverage of shark-human conflicts may lead humans to overestimate the risk of being attacked. We recommend increased communication between stakeholders to establish ground rules for media reporting of shark-human conflicts, better informed reporting of attacks, further research undertaken to understand the public's perception of media reporting of conflicts and continued investment in communication, education, and public awareness programs. Through these actions it will be possible to rebalance the public perception of sharks to promote understanding and value of their ecological role and to minimize human-shark incidents.",Carnivore | Education programs | Human–killers | Media | Shark attack,2,1,,350159/2016-5,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Journal of Avian Biology © 2019 Nordic Society Oikos In birds with song repertoires, song-type matching occurs when an individual responds to another individual's song by producing the same song type. Song-type matching has been described in multiple bird species and a growing body of evidence suggests that song-type matching may serve as a conventional signal of aggression, particularly in male birds in the temperate zone. Few studies have investigated song-type matching in tropical birds or female birds, in spite of the fact that avian biodiversity is highest in the tropics, that female song is widespread in the tropics, and that female song is the ancestral state among songbirds. In this study of rufous-and-white wrens Thryophilus rufalbus, a resident neotropical songbird where both sexes sing, we presented territorial males and females with playback that simulated a territorial rival producing shared and unshared songs. In response, both males and females sang matched song types at levels statistically equal to levels expected by chance. Furthermore, males and females exhibited similar levels of aggression and similar vocal behaviours in response to playback of both shared and unshared songs. These results indicate that rufous-and-white wrens do not use song-type matching in territorial conflicts as a conventional signal of aggression. We discuss alternative hypotheses for the function of song-type sharing in tropical birds. In particular, we point out that shared songs may play an important role in intra-pair communication, especially for birds where males and females combine their songs in vocal duets, and this may supersede the function of song-type matching in some tropical birds.",acoustic behaviour | conventional signals | duets | female song | signal honesty | song | Thryothorus rufalbus | tropical birds,0,0,,undefined,

A great deal of ground breaking work has determined that the Tuberin and Hamartin Complex function as a negative regulator of protein synthesis and cell cycle progression through G1/S. This is largely attributed to the GTPase activity of Tuberin that indirectly inhibits the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). During times of ample nutrition Tuberin is inhibited by growth factor signaling, including direct phosphorylation by Akt/PKB, allowing for activation of mTOR and subsequent protein synthesis. It is well rationalized that maintaining homeostasis requires communication between cell growth (mTOR signaling) and cell division (cell cycle regulation), however how this occurs mechanistically has not been resolved. This work demonstrates that in the presence of high serum, and/or Akt signaling, direct binding between Tuberin and the G2/M cyclin, Cyclin B1, is stabilized and the rate of mitotic entry is decreased. Importantly, we show that this results in an increase in cell size. We propose that this represents a novel cell cycle checkpoint linking mitotic onset with the nutritional status of the cell to control cell growth.",,1,1,CIHR,undefined,Canadian Institutes of Health Research

Tag burdens ranged from 1.8% to 7.5% across the two species. Growth rates in acoustic-tagged fish were equal to or higher than those in other treatments. Acoustic-tagged S. namaycush had a marginally lower Ucrit than controls but that effect was not replicated in the O. mykiss experiment. Tagging did not have clear effects on metabolic rate but there was an interaction whereby SMR and RMR tended to increase with time since surgery in tagged O. mykiss but not in other treatments (the same trend did not occur in S. namaycush). Survival was high across treatments (mean 98% survival among O. mykiss, 97.5% among S. namaycush). There were no statistically significant effects of tag burden (percentage of body mass) except for a weak negative relationship with growth rate (across species) and a weak positive relationship with Ucrit but only in the O. mykiss. Collectively, our findings suggest there were minor, context-dependent effects of acoustic tagging in juvenile S. namaycush and O. mykiss during an eight-week laboratory experiment.

The monarch butterfly (Danaus plexippus), an iconic species that migrates annually across North America, has steeply declined in numbers over the past decade. Across the species’ range, public, private, and non-profit organizations aim to reverse the monarch decline by engaging in conservation activities such as habitat restoration, larvae monitoring, and butterfly tagging. Urban residents can actively participate in these activities, yet their contribution can also be realized as an electorate body able to influence the design of conservation programs according to their interests. Little is known, however about their preferences toward the objectives and design of international monarch conservation policies. In this paper, we investigate these preferences via a survey design using Discrete Choice Experiments (DCEs) and Latent Class Analysis (LC) of urban residents across the main eastern migratory flyway in Ontario, Canada, and the eastern United States. Attributes in the DCE included the size and trend of overwintering butterfly colonies, the type of institution leading the conservation program, international allocation of funds, and the percentage of funds dedicated to research. From the general populace, we isolated respondents already engaged in monarch conservation activities to explore how they compare. We sent a smaller set of surveys deliberately withholding the expected-success forecast of the monarch recovery program to assess the value of information for urban residents within a conservation context. The LC distinguished three groups of respondents among urban residents: (1) the main group, labeled “Eager,” accounting for 72.4% of the sample, that showed a high potential for supporting conservation policies and had remarkable similarities with the monarch enthusiasts’ sample; (2) a “Pro Nation” group (18.4%) marked by their increased willingness to support conservation initiatives solely focused within their country of residence; and (3) an “Opinionated” segment (9.23%), that was highly reactive to changes of the leading institution, resources allocation, and economic contribution proposed. Key findings from this research reveal that to maximize potential support amongst urban residents in the monarch’s breeding range, a conservation strategy for the monarch butterfly should be led by not-for-profit organizations, should strive for transboundary cooperation, and should include the communication of anticipated ecological outcomes.",Choice experiment | Citizen science | Conservation | International cooperation | Latent class | Monarch butterfly | Public preferences | Transboundary conservation,0,1,SSHRC,31-639962,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada

Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland. Acid mine drainage (AMD) remediation commonly produces byproducts which must be stored or utilized to reduce the risk of further contamination. A mussel shell bioreactor has been implemented at a coal mine in New Zealand, which is an effective remediation option, although an accumulated sludge layer decreased efficiency which was then removed and requires storage. To understand associated risks related to storage or use of the AMD sludge material, a laboratory mesocosm study investigated the physio-chemical and biological influence in two conditions: anoxic storage (burial deep within a waste rock dump) or exposure to oxic environments (use of sludge on the surface of the mine). Solid phase characterization by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and selective extraction was completed to compare two environmental conditions (oxic and anoxic) under biologically active and abiotic systems (achieved by gamma irradiation). Changes in microbial community structure were monitored using 16s rDNA amplification and next-generation sequencing. The results indicate that microbes in an oxic environment increase the formation of oxyhydroxides and acidic conditions increase metal mobility. In an oxic and circumneutral environment, the AMD sludge may be repurposed to act as an oxygen barrier for mine tailings or soil amendment. Anoxic conditions would likely promote the biomineralization of sulfide minerals in the AMD sludge by sulfate reducing bacteria (SRB), which were abundant in the system. The anoxic conditions reduced the risk of trace metals (Zn) associated with oxides, but increased Fe associated with organic material. In summary, fewer risks are associated with anoxic burial but repurposing in an oxic condition may be appropriate under favorable conditions.",Acid mine drainage | Bioremediation | Contaminate waste storage | Mesocosm | Microbiology | Mussel shells,0,1,NSERC,860006,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

There was no clear latitudinal trend in nutrient or contaminant concentrations.

Concentrations of EPA + DHA were related to lipid content, but to a greater extent for higher trophic position species (R2 = 0.83) than for species at lower trophic positions (R2 = 0.61). Selenium concentrations were higher in sand lance (1.15 ± 0.16 μg g−1) than in all other species (0.30–0.69 μg g−1), which was significantly, but weakly, explained by more pelagic feeding in sand lance.

(S)-2,4-Diaminobutanoic acid (DABA) is a noncanonical amino acid often co-produced by cyanobacteria along with β-N-methylamino-l-alanine (BMAA) in algal blooms. Although BMAA is a well-established neurotoxin, the toxicity of DABA remains unclear. As part of our development of biocompatible materials, we wish to make use of DABA as both a building block and as the end-product of enzymatically induced depolymerization; however, if it is toxic at very low concentrations, this would not be possible. We examined the toxicity of DABA using both in vivo embryonic and adult zebrafish models. At higher sublethal concentrations (700 μm), the fish demonstrated early signs of cardiotoxicity. Adolescent zebrafish were able to tolerate a higher concentration. Post-mortem histological analysis of juvenile zebrafish showed no liver or brain abnormalities associated with hepato- or neurotoxicity. Combined, these results show that DABA exhibits no overt toxicity at concentrations (100-300 μm) within an order of magnitude of those envisioned for its application. This study further highlights the low cost and ease of using zebrafish as an early-stage toxicological screening tool.",cyanobacteria | DABA | diaminobutanoic acid | GABA | toxicity | zebrafish,0,0,NSERC,312014‐2009,University of Windsor

The Journal of Comparative Neurology published by Wiley Periodicals, Inc. Detection of chemical cues is important to guide locomotion in association with feeding and sexual behavior. Two neural pathways responsible for odor-evoked locomotion have been characterized in the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus L.), a basal vertebrate. There is a medial pathway originating in the medial olfactory bulb (OB) and a lateral pathway originating from the rest of the OB. These olfactomotor pathways are present throughout the life cycle of lampreys, but olfactory-driven behaviors differ according to the developmental stage. Among possible mechanisms, dopaminergic (DA) modulation in the OB might explain the behavioral changes. Here, we examined DA modulation of olfactory transmission in lampreys. Immunofluorescence against DA revealed immunoreactivity in the OB that was denser in the medial part (medOB), where processes were observed close to primary olfactory afferents and projection neurons. Dopaminergic neurons labeled by tracer injections in the medOB were located in the OB, the posterior tuberculum, and the dorsal hypothalamic nucleus, suggesting the presence of both intrinsic and extrinsic DA innervation. Electrical stimulation of the olfactory nerve in an in vitro whole-brain preparation elicited synaptic responses in reticulospinal cells that were modulated by DA. Local injection of DA agonists in the medOB decreased the reticulospinal cell responses whereas the D2 receptor antagonist raclopride increased the response amplitude. These observations suggest that DA in the medOB could modulate odor-evoked locomotion. Altogether, these results show the presence of a DA innervation within the medOB that may play a role in modulating olfactory inputs to the motor command system of lampreys.",anatomical tracing | dopamine | immunofluorescence | lamprey | locomotion | olfaction | olfactory bulb | RRID: AB_2314665 | RRID: AB_2336881 | RRID: AB_2338881 | RRID: AB_2534079 | RRID: AB_390204 | RRID: AB_94817,0,1,,undefined,

The complex geopolitical layout of exclusive economic zones (EEZs) in the Western Indian Ocean (WIO) introduces the potential for migratory species to cross multiple boundaries, consequently a lack of scientific data could complicate regional management. In the current study, we highlight both the relative lack of spatial data available in the WIO, and the prevalence of transboundary movements in species that have previously been studied in the region. Five tiger sharks Galeocerdo cuvier were tracked with near real-time positioning (SPOT) satellite tags to determine individual shark movements relative to EEZs within the WIO. Concurrently, a literature search was performed to identify all satellite telemetry studies conducted to date in the WIO for marine megafunal species, and the results compared to global satellite telemetry effort. Finally, the satellite tracks of all marine species monitored in the WIO were extracted and digitized to examine the scale of transboundary movements that occur in the region. Tiger sharks exhibited both coastal and oceanic movements, with one individual crossing a total of eight EEZs. Satellite telemetry effort in the WIO has not matched the global increase, with only 4.7% of global studies occurring in the region. Species in the WIO remained within the EEZ in which they were tagged in only three studies, while all other species demonstrated some level of transboundary movement. This study demonstrates the lack of spatial data available for informed regional management in an area where transboundary movements by marine megafuna are highly prevalent. Without more dedicated funding and research, the rich biodiversity of the WIO is at risk of overexploitation from the diverse threats present within the various political regions.",exclusive economic zones | migration | satellite tags | spatial management | tiger sharks | tracking | transboundary | Western Indian Ocean,0,0,ANB,undefined,Agentschap voor Natuur en Bos

A developing body of theory and empirical evidence suggest that feeding behaviour as measured by the functional response (FR) can assist researchers in assessing the relative potential, ecological impacts and competitive abilities of native and introduced species. Here, we explored the FRs of two land snails that occur in south-western Ontario, one native (Mesodon thyroidus) and one non-indigenous (Cepaea nemoralis) to Canada. The non-indigenous species appears to have low ecological impact and inferior competitive abilities. Consistent with theory, while both species conformed to Type II functional responses, the native species had a significantly higher attack rate (5.30 vs 0.41, respectively) and slightly lower handling time (0.020 vs 0.023), and hence a higher maximum feeding rate (50.0 vs 43.5). The non-indigenous species exhibited a significantly longer time to contact for a variety of food types, and appeared less discriminating of paper that was offered as a non-food type. The non-indigenous species also ate significantly less food when in mixed species trials with the native snail. These feeding patterns match the known low ecological impact of the introduced snail and are consistent with the view that it is an inferior competitor relative to the native species. However, field experimentation is required to clarify whether the largely microallopatric distributions of the two species in south-western Ontario reflect competitive dominance by the native species or other factors such as habitat preference, feeding preferences or predator avoidance. The relative patterns of feeding behaviour and ecological impact are, however, fully in line with recent functional response theory and application.",Alien species | Functional response | Interspecific competition | Non-indigenous species,0,1,NSERC,2018FY001-007,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Coastal wetlands of the Laurentian Great Lakes are vital habitats for biota of ecological and economic importance. These habitats are susceptible to water quality impairments driven by runoff from the landscape due to their location along the shoreline. Monitoring of the overall status of biotic and abiotic conditions of coastal wetlands within the Great Lakes has been ongoing for over a decade. Here, we utilize measurements of aquatic physicochemical and land cover variables from 877 vegetation zones in 511 coastal wetland sites spanning the US and Canadian shorelines of the entire Great Lakes basin. Our objective is to develop water quality indices based on physicochemical measures (Chem-Rank), land use/land cover (LULC-Rank), and their combined effects (Sum-Rank and Simplified Sum-Rank), for both vegetation zones and wetland sites. We found that water quality differed among wetland vegetation types and among Great Lakes regions, corroborating previous findings that human land use alters coastal wetland water quality. Future monitoring can use these straightforward, easy-to-calculate indices to assess the abiotic condition of aquatic habitats. Our data support the need for management efforts focused on reducing nutrient and pollution loads that stem from human activities, particularly in the developed southern portions of the Great Lakes basin.",Anthropogenic | Coastal wetland | Disturbance | Great Lakes | Land use | Water quality index,0,1,GVSU,GL-00E00612-0,Grand Valley State University

Shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) are among the most numerous consumers in the Arctic nearshore marine habitats. Despite this, little is known about their movement ecology or predator–prey interactions, particularly with Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), an important forage fish in the Arctic. Using acoustic telemetry, the movements of tagged sculpin and cod were quantified based on specific locations using a Vemco positioning system during open water when both species were present in the near shore. Movement trajectories of sculpin distinguish three unique types: foraging and feeding behaviour and large transiting movements. The relative time of each of these movement types were correlated to biotic (presence of large numbers of acoustically tagged Arctic cod) and abiotic factors (percent ice coverage and temperature). This study provides unique data on the movement, feeding ecology, and behaviour of an abundant Arctic benthic fish that demonstrates similar movement types to temperate fish. However, further study is needed to quantify specifically the trophic interactions of these important fish and impact on food webs in the rapidly changing Arctic.",,2,0,,undefined,Adam Taliaferro Foundation

Long-lived species share life history traits such as slow growth, late maturity, and low fecundity, which lead to slow recovery rates and increase a population's vulnerability to disturbance. The Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) has recently been recognized as the world's longest-lived vertebrate, but many questions regarding its biology, physiology, and ecology remain unanswered. Here we review how current and future research will fill knowledge gaps about the Greenland shark and provide an overall framework to guide research and management priorities for this species. Key advances include the potential for specialized aging techniques and demographic studies to shed light on the distribution and age-class structure of Greenland shark populations. Advances in population genetics and genomics will reveal key factors contributing to the Greenland shark's extreme longevity, range and population size, and susceptibility to environmental change. New tagging technologies and improvements in experimental and analytical design will allow detailed monitoring of movement behaviors and interactions among Greenland sharks and other marine species, while shedding light on habitat use and susceptibility to fisheries interactions. Interdisciplinary approaches, such as the combined use of stable isotope analysis and high-tech data-logging devices (i.e., accelerometers and acoustic hydrophones) have the potential to improve knowledge of feeding strategies, predatory capabilities, and the trophic role of Greenland sharks. Measures of physiology, including estimation of metabolic rate, as well as heart rate and function, will advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of long lifespans.

Traditionally, ecosystem monitoring, conservation, and restoration have been conducted in a piecemeal manner at the local scale without regional landscape context. However, scientifically driven conservation and restoration decisions benefit greatly when they are based on regionally determined benchmarks and goals. Unfortunately, required data sets rarely exist for regionally important ecosystems. Because of early recognition of the extreme ecological importance of Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands, and the extensive degradation that had already occurred, significant investments in coastal wetland research, protection, and restoration have been made in recent decades and continue today. Continued and refined assessment of wetland condition and trends, and the evaluation of restoration practices are all essential to ensuring the success of these investments. To provide wetland managers and decision makers throughout the Laurentian Great Lakes basin with the optimal tools and data needed to make scientifically-based decisions, our regional team of Great Lakes wetland scientists developed standardized methods and indicators used for assessing wetland condition. From a landscape perspective, at the Laurentian Great Lakes ecosystem scale, we established a stratified random-site-selection process to monitor birds, anurans, fish, macroinvertebrates, vegetation, and physicochemical conditions of coastal wetlands in the US and Canada. Monitoring of approximately 200 wetlands per year began in 2011 as the Great Lakes Coastal Wetland Monitoring Program. In this paper, we describe the development, delivery, and expected results of this ongoing international, multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder, landscape-scale monitoring program as a case example of successful application of landscape conservation design.",Coastal wetlands | Ecosystem health | Monitoring | The Laurentian Great Lakes,0,0,,undefined,

White sharks, Carcharodon carcharias, are often described as elusive, with little information available due to the logistical difficulties of studying large marine predators that make long-distance migrations across ocean basins. Increased understanding of aggregation patterns, combined with recent advances in technology have, however, facilitated a new breadth of studies revealing fresh insights into the biology and ecology of white sharks. Although we may no longer be able to refer to the white shark as a little-known, elusive species, there remain numerous key questions that warrant investigation and research focus. Although white sharks have separate populations, they seemingly share similar biological and ecological traits across their global distribution. Yet, white shark's behavior and migratory patterns can widely differ, which makes formalizing similarities across its distribution challenging. Prioritization of research questions is important to maximize limited resources because white sharks are naturally low in abundance and play important regulatory roles in the ecosystem. Here, we consulted 43 white shark experts to identify these issues. The questions listed and developed here provide a global road map for future research on white sharks to advance progress toward key goals that are informed by the needs of the research community and resource managers.",Carcharodon carcharias | Feeding ecology | Movement | TEPS management | Threatened species conservation | Threats | Wildlife tourism,4,1,,undefined,

Journal of Evolutionary Biology © 2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology In oviparous species, maternal carotenoid provisioning can deliver diverse fitness benefits to offspring via increased survival, growth and immune function. Despite demonstrated advantages of carotenoids, large intra- and interspecific variation in carotenoid utilization exists, suggesting trade-offs associated with carotenoids. In Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), extreme variation in carotenoid utilization delineates two colour morphs (red and white) that differ genetically in their ability to deposit carotenoids into tissues. Here, we take advantage of this natural variation to examine how large differences in maternal carotenoid provisioning influence offspring fitness. Using a full factorial breeding design crossing morphs and common-garden rearing, we measured differences in a suite of fitness-related traits, including survival, growth, viral susceptibility and host response, in offspring of red (carotenoid-rich eggs) and white (carotenoid-poor eggs) females. Eggs of red females had significantly higher carotenoid content than those of white females (6× more); however, this did not translate into measurable differences in offspring fitness. Given that white Chinook salmon may have evolved to counteract their maternal carotenoid deficiency, we also examined the relationship between egg carotenoid content and offspring fitness within each morph separately. Egg carotenoids only had a positive effect within the red morph on survival to eyed-egg (earliest measured trait), but not within the white morph. Although previous work shows that white females benefit from reduced egg predation, our study also supports a hypothesis that white Chinook salmon have evolved additional mechanisms to improve egg survival despite low carotenoids, providing novel insight into evolutionary mechanisms that maintain this stable polymorphism.",carotenoid pigmentation | common garden | gene expression | genetic polymorphisms | infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus,2,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

A non-steady state bioenergetics/toxicokinetic model was developed to simulate PCB and Hg concentrations in these two species and compared with field data. Simulations using constant whole body growth rate and constant tissue to whole body weight ratios were contrasted against simulations adopting age specific whole body and tissue/age specific growth rates for their goodness of fit to field data. The simulations using age/tissue specific growth rates demonstrated better fit to field data for PCBs compared to the constant growth rate models (22% improved R2), while both models explained similar variation in Hg concentration data. Both species demonstrated higher growth rates of lipids (on a daily basis) relative to whole body and protein contributing to higher growth dilution of PCBs compared to Hg. Although stable isotope data indicated some degree of diet and/or habitat shift, simulations assuming a constant diet concentration explained between 36 and 40% of the variation in fish concentrations for both contaminants and fish species. This study demonstrates that differences in the bioaccumulation rate of PCBs and Hg by Asian carp can be partially explained by differences in the growth rates of key tissue storage compartments associated with each contaminant. These differences in chemical-specific growth dilution subsequently contribute to differences in chemical retention and bioaccumulation patterns of Hg and PCBs by fish.",Asian carp | Bioenergetics | Mercury | Persistent organic pollutants | Toxicokinetics,3,0,,2013CB430004,China Scholarship Council

Conventional PCR (cPCR) and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) are two widely used approaches employed in environmental DNA (eDNA) detection, though lack of a comprehensive comparison of them impedes method selection. Here we test detection capacity and false negative rate of both approaches using samples with different expected complexities. We compared cPCR and qPCR to detect invasive, biofouling golden mussels (Limnoperna fortunei), in samples from laboratory aquaria and irrigation channels where this mussel was known to occur in central China. Where applicable, the limit of detection (LoD), limit of quantification (LoQ), detection rate, and false negative rate of each PCR method were tested. Quantitative PCR achieved a lower LoD than cPCR (1 × 10 −7 vs. 10 −6  ng/μl) and had a higher detection rate for both laboratory (100% vs. 87.9%) and field (68.6% vs. 47.1%) samples. Field water samples could only be quantified at a higher concentration than laboratory aquaria and total genomic DNA, indicating inhibition with environmental samples. The false negative rate was inversely related to the number of sample replicates. Target eDNA concentration was negatively related to distance from sampling sites to the water (and animal) source. Detection capacity difference between cPCR and qPCR for genomic DNA and laboratory aquaria can be translated to field water samples, and the latter should be prioritized in rare species detection. Field environmental samples may involve more complexities—such as inhibitors—than laboratory aquaria samples, requiring more target DNA. Extensive sampling is critical in field applications using either approach to reduce false negatives.",eDNA | environmental DNA | false negative | golden mussel | qPCR | rare species,0,1,,31622011,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

As a dividing cell exits mitosis and daughter cells enter interphase, many proteins must be dephosphorylated. The protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) with its B55 regulatory subunit plays a crucial role in this transition, but the identity of its substrates and how their dephosphorylation promotes mitotic exit are largely unknown. We conducted a maternal-effect screen in Drosophila melanogaster to identify genes that function with PP2A-B55/Tws in the cell cycle. We found that eggs that receive reduced levels of Tws and of components of the nuclear envelope (NE) often fail development, concomitant with NE defects following meiosis and in syncytial mitoses. Our mechanistic studies using Drosophila cells indicate that PP2A-Tws promotes nuclear envelope reformation (NER) during mitotic exit by dephosphorylating BAF and suggests that PP2A-Tws targets additional NE components, including Lamin and Nup107. This work establishes Drosophila as a powerful model to further dissect the molecular mechanisms of NER and suggests additional roles of PP2A-Tws in the completion of meiosis and mitosis.",,4,1,,MOP-133558,Canada Foundation for Innovation

Optimal growth was seen at 14–18 °C when grown in Leibovitz's L-15 media with 20% fetal bovine serum. DNA analyses confirmed that CHSS was Chinook salmon and genetically different from the only other available Chinook salmon cell line, CHSE-214. Unlike CHSE-214, CHSS could bind extracellular dsRNA, resulting in the rapid and robust expression of antiviral genes. Receptor/ligand blocking assays confirmed that class A scavenger receptors (SR-A) facilitated dsRNA binding and subsequent gene expression. Although both cell lines expressed three SR-A genes: SCARA3, SCARA4, and SCARA5, only CHSS appeared to have functional cell-surface SR-As for dsRNA. Collectively, CHSS is an excellent cell model to study dsRNA-mediated innate immunity in Chinook salmon.",Cell line | Chinook salmon | dsRNA | Innate immunity | Interferon-stimulated genes | polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid,5,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

How the clock regulates stem cells is an emerging area of research with many outstanding questions. We tested clock function in vivo at the single cell resolution in the Drosophila intestine, a tissue that is exquisitely sensitive to environmental cues and has circadian rhythms in regeneration. Our results indicate that circadian clocks function in intestinal stem cells and enterocytes but are downregulated during enteroendocrine cell differentiation. Drosophila intestinal cells are principally synchronized by the photoperiod, but intestinal stem cell clocks are highly responsive to signaling pathways that comprise their niche, and we find that the Wnt and Hippo signaling pathways positively regulate stem cell circadian clock function. These data reveal that intestinal stem cell circadian rhythms are regulated by cellular signaling and provide insight as to how clocks may be altered during physiological changes such as regeneration and aging. Parasram and colleagues demonstrate that circadian clock function is present throughout the intestinal epithelium, except in the enteroendocrine cell lineage. Cellular communication that influences intestinal stem cell clock function is regulated by pathways in the stem cell niche: Notch, Wnt, and Hippo signaling. Circadian clocks are functional in many physiological contexts, where they can be synchronized by photoperiod or the timing of food intake.",circadian rhythms | Drosophila | intestinal stem cells,1,1,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Invertebrate species carried incidentally (i.e., ‘hitchhikers’) in the aquarium trade have gained increasing attention in recent years, but factors affecting the movement of species from stores to homes are poorly understood. We aimed to determine how macrophytes bought from stores act as vectors for transport of non-indigenous invertebrate species. We tested whether incidental invertebrate faunas carried on macrophytes vary internationally by comparing the New Zealand and Canadian trades, and if macrophyte species with different morphologies carry different risks. We recorded a large variety of invertebrate species associated with Vallisneria spp., Sword plants (Echinodorus spp.) and Elodea canadensis bought from stores, including species non-indigenous to both countries. Community composition of incidental fauna differed significantly between New Zealand (primarily domestically cultivated) and Canadian (primarily imported) bought macrophytes. Differences in composition between different macrophyte species were only statistically significant between wild-collected E. canadensis and the cultured species in New Zealand. Behaviours observed in stores, such as the amount of time macrophytes were removed from water before being placed in plastic bags for transport, did not affect the abundances or richness of incidental invertebrates transported, and thus did not appear to be effective in reducing invasion risk. We therefore recommend chemical treatment for removal of invertebrates from macrophytes at or pre-border, and from tanks containing plants at culture facilities and in stores. Such management will reduce the probability of introduction of hitchhikers to home aquaria, from which risk of release to natural waters is greatest.",Aquarium trade | Biological invasions | Copepoda | Hitchhikers | Incidental fauna | Ornamental plants,2,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

The regional crop growths are affected by inter-annual climatic conditions and intra-seasonal variability. Consequently, monthly climate change projection data can provide more useful information for crop management than seasonal climate projections. However, very few studies undertaken for the Great Lakes Basin have focused on monthly timescales. In this study, we investigate the projected mid-century (2030–2059) monthly mean maximum temperature (Tmax) and minimum temperature changes of this region, relative to the baseline period (1980–2009). Future Tmax increases in this region are likely to be greater during the May to October period (coinciding with the region's growing season) than in other months. The order of magnitude of future Tmax and Tmin changes of the five Great Lakes sub-basins are Superior > Huron > Michigan > Erie and Ontario. Most future Tmax changes over land areas are higher than those over the lakes, whereas Tmin changes are likely to be higher over lakes than over the adjacent land areas in this region. The future number of extreme warm days (Tmax ≥ 29–32 °C) in this region will increase by between about 5 days (in the north) to 40 days (in southern parts of the basin), while the number of winter cold days (Tmax ≤ −5 °C ~ 0 °C) may decrease by between 3 days (south) and 35 days (north). This study furthermore identifies some fluctuations of latitudinal temperature gradients in the Great Lakes Basin, these areas covering the north latitude 40.5–41.5° 43.5–44.0° 45.5–46.5° and 47.5–49.5°.",Fluctuations of latitudinal temperature gradients | Great Lakes Basin | Monthly temperature | Tmax and Tmin,0,0,,undefined,Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry

We developed an innovative playback technology involving automated loudspeakers that broadcast songs with distinctive acoustic signatures.

We confirm that wild birds learn songs by listening to adult conspecific animals, and we show that they pass these songs on to subsequent generations. Further, we provide the first experimental evidence in the wild that the timing of exposure to tutor song influences vocal learning: wild Savannah Sparrows preferentially learn songs heard during both their natal summer and at the outset of their first breeding season.

By studying which signals are associated with aggressive interactions, we gain a deeper appreciation of animal behaviour. We studied aggressive signalling in male Savannah Sparrows, Passerculus sandwichensis, focusing on signals that precede physical attack against territorial intruders. We simulated intruders using song playback and taxidermic models, and we determined which behaviours were associated with physical attack. Previous studies that have used this approach suggest that many species produce songs of dramatically lower amplitude, or “soft songs,” as signals of aggressive intention. Savannah Sparrows, however, are not known to produce soft songs, and therefore, they provided an interesting system for testing signals that predict attack. Of 93 playback subjects, 23 males attacked the simulated intruder and 70 did not. To our surprise, Savannah Sparrows produced soft songs, and the number of soft songs was a significant predictor of attack on the simulated intruder. Birds also showed a nonsignificant tendency to produce more “chip” calls prior to attack on the simulated intruder, whereas three other measured behaviours (aggressive calls, wing waving and passes over the model) did not predict attack. Our study contributes to the growing body of research on aggressive territorial signals and reveals that soft song is an even more widespread signal of aggression in songbirds than previously recognized.",aggressive signalling | animal communication | low-amplitude vocalizations | Savannah Sparrows | soft songs,1,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

In 2007, the first miniature light-level geolocators were deployed on small landbirds, revolutionizing the study of migration. In this paper, we review studies that have used geolocators to track small landbirds with the goal of summarizing research themes and identifying remaining important gaps in understanding. We also highlight research and opportunities using 2 recently developed tracking technologies: archival GPS tags and automated radio-telemetry systems. In our review, we found that most (54%) geolocator studies focused on quantifying natural history of migration, such as identifying migration routes, nonbreeding range, and migration timing. Studies of behavioral ecology (20%) uncovered proximate drivers of movements, including en route habitat quality; that migration routes, but not timing, may be flexible in some species; and different age and sex classes show significant differences in migration strategy. Studies of the evolution of migration (9%) have illustrated that migration is a potential barrier to hybridizing species or subspecies, and some work has correlated gene polymorphisms and methylation patterns with migration behavior. Studies of migratory connectivity (11%) have shown that a moderate level of connectivity is common, although variability across and within species exists. Studies of seasonal interactions (7%) have found mixed results: in some cases, carryover effects have been identified; in other cases, carryover effects are buffered during intervening stages of the annual cycle. Archival GPS tags provide unprecedented precision in locations of nonbreeding sites and migration routes, and will continue to improve understanding of migration across large spatial scales. Automated radio-telemetry systems are revolutionizing our knowledge of migratory stopover biology, and have led to discoveries of previously unknown stopover behaviors. Together, these tracking technologies will continue to provide insight into small migratory landbird movements and contribute important information for conservation of this rapidly declining group.",geo-logging | geolocation | method | movement | songbird | tracking,18,0,,undefined,Bird Studies Canada

Climate change is leading to northward shifts in species distributions that is altering interspecific interactions at low- and mid-trophic levels. However, little attention has been focused on the effects of redistributions of species on the trophic ecology of a high trophic-level predator assemblage. Here, during a 22-year period (1990-2012) of increasing sea temperature (1.08C) and decreasing sea ice extent (12%) in Cumberland Sound, Nunavut, Canada, we examined the trophic structure of a near-apex predator assemblage before (1990-2002) and after (2005-2012) an increase in the availability of capelin-generally an indicator species in colder marine environments for a warming climate. Stable isotopes (d13C and d15N) were used in a Bayesian framework to assess shifts in diet, niche size and community-wide metrics for beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas), ringed seals (Pusa hispida), Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and anadromous Arctic char (Salvelinus alpinus). After 2005, consumption of forage fish increased for all predator species, suggesting diet flexibility with changing abiotic and biotic conditions. An associated temporal shift from a trophically diverse to a trophically redundant predator assemblage occurred where predators now play similar trophic roles by consuming prey primarily from the pelagic energy pathway. Overall, these long-term ecological changes signify that trophic shifts of a high trophic-level predator assemblage associated with climate change have occurred in the Arctic food web.",Climate change | Community-wide metrics | Fishes | Food web structure | Marine mammals | Stable isotopes,1,1,,undefined,W.

Shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius) commonly occur in nearshore areas during open water periods in the Arctic, yet little is known about their feeding strategies or trophic roles. This study used carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) stable isotopes (SIs) and stomach content analysis (SCA) to assess shorthorn sculpin trophic position (TP), carbon sources, dietary specialization and prey selection, and the significance of polar cod (Boreogadus saida) in their diet across body size and multiple years. Sculpin TP increased with body size [range = 4.0 ± 0.1 (< 20 cm) to 4.6 ± 0.2 (> 25 cm)] and was consistent with SCA; smaller individuals fed predominantly on invertebrates while larger fed more on fishes. Shorthorn sculpin had high % reliance on pelagic resources (α) for a benthic fish, from 0.62 ± 0.05 to 0.63 ± 0.06, thus coupling benthic and pelagic sources. Dietary specialization based on SIs in liver and muscle occurred in all size groups, and along with TP and niche width varied between years, generally increasing with fish found in SCA. The presence of polar cod, absent two of the four study years, did not significantly affect any dietary metrics measured in shorthorn sculpin, and cannibalism appears to have had a greater impact on shorthorn sculpin trophic ecology. This study demonstrates that shorthorn sculpin are an important secondary to tertiary consumer in nearshore Arctic marine habitats due to coupling multiple trophic pathways, demonstrating plasticity in diet between years, and exploiting an array of prey across size ranges.",Arctic food webs | Dietary specialization | Shorthorn sculpin | Trophic position,1,0,,AUPP 12-13,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

It is only recently that the neural substrate underlying olfactomotor behaviors in vertebrates was uncovered in lampreys. It consists of a neural pathway extending from the medial part of the olfactory bulb (medOB) to locomotor control centers in the brainstem via a single relay in the caudal diencephalon. This hardwired olfactomotor pathway is present throughout life and may be responsible for the olfactory-induced motor behaviors seen at all life stages. We investigated modulatory mechanisms acting on this pathway by conducting anatomical (tract tracing and immunohistochemistry) and physiological (intracellular recordings and calcium imaging) experiments on lamprey brain preparations. We show that the GABAergic circuitry of the olfactory bulb (OB) acts as a gatekeeper of this hardwired sensorimotor pathway. We also demonstrate the presence of a novel olfactomotor pathway that originates in the non-medOB and consists of a projection to the lateral pallium (LPal) that, in turn, projects to the caudal diencephalon and to the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR).

Biotic indicators are useful for assessing ecosystem health because the structure of resident communities generally reflects abiotic conditions integrated over time. We used fish data collected over 5 years for 470 Great Lakes coastal wetlands to develop multi-metric indices of biotic integrity (IBI). Sampling and IBI development were stratified by vegetation type within each wetland to account for differences in physical habitat. Metrics were evaluated against numerous indices of anthropogenic disturbance derived from water quality and surrounding land-cover variables. Separate datasets were used for IBI development and testing. IBIs were composed of 10–11 metrics for each of four vegetation types (bulrush, cattail, water lily, and submersed aquatic vegetation). Scores of all IBIs correlated well with disturbance indices using the development data, and the accuracy of our IBIs was validated using the testing data. Our fish IBIs can be used to prioritize wetland protection and restoration efforts across the Great Lakes basin. The IBIs will also be useful in monitoring programs mandated by the Agreement between Canada and the United States of America on Great Lakes Water Quality, such as for assessing Beneficial Use Impairments (BUIs) in Great Lakes Areas of Concern, and in other ecosystem management programs in Canada and the USA.",Bioassessment | Biotic indicator | Coastal marsh | Fish | Land use | Laurentian Great Lakes | Water quality | Wetland,3,1,,GL-00E00612-0,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

Microplastics were spiked with 14 environmentally rare PCBs and incorporated into fish pellets previously spiked with a technical PCB mixture (Aroclor 1254). Five diet treatments were created having microplastic contents of 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25% and fed to fish within 24 h of the diet creation. Fish from each treatment were fed a microplastic amended food pellet and PCB AEs were determined by mass balance. Microplastic-associated PCBs had lower AEs (geomean 13.36%) compared to food matrix-associated PCBs (geomean 51.64%). There were interactions between PCB AEs and the microplastic content of the diet. PCBs affiliated with microplastics became more bioavailable with increasing microplastic content of food while food matrix-associated PCB bioavailability declined when microplastic contents exceeded 5%. Despite controlling for microplastic-food contact time, there was some evidence for redistribution of lower KOW food matrix-associated PCBs onto microplastics causing a decrease in their AE relative to nonplastic and low plastic containing diets. The low bioavailability of microplastic-associated PCBs observed in the present study provides further support to indicate that microplastics are unlikely to increase POPs bioaccumulation by fish in aquatic systems.",,2,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

One seldom-studied hypothesis for duets is the paternity guarding hypothesis, which states that male animals create duets to advertise their partner's mated status and minimize extrapair mating attempts between their partner and other males. We experimentally tested the paternity guarding hypothesis in rufous-and-white wrens, Thryophilus rufalbus, a neotropical duetting songbird. We designed a two-part playback experiment: males first experienced a simulated territorial intrusion by a rival male, and were then given opportunities to answer their female breeding partner's songs to create duets. We repeated this experiment during the female's fertile and nonfertile breeding stages. In support of predictions of the paternity guarding hypothesis, male wrens created more duets with their partner's songs during the fertile period compared to the nonfertile period. Additionally, male wrens appeared to physically guard their mates with greater intensity during the fertile period but did not increase their overall song rates, demonstrating that increased duetting rates during the fertile period were a result of a change in male duetting behaviour, rather than a change in song rate. Our study is among the first to experimentally test the paternity guarding hypothesis for duet function, and suggests that male rufous-and-white wrens use both vocal and physical behaviours to guard their paternity.",duetting | mate guarding | paternity guarding | rufous-and-white wren | Thryophilus rufalbus | Thryothorus rufalbus,2,0,,undefined,American Ornithological Society

Aquatic alien invasive species (AIS) are a substantial and increasing threat to biodiversity and ecosystem function worldwide. In particular, invasive aquatic macrophytes, such as the South African curly waterweed Lagarosiphon major ((Ridley) Moss 1928), induce major environmental change that often culminates in wide-ranging ecological and socio-economic impacts. Currently, there is a lack of effective biosecurity protocols to mitigate against such invader spread. Here, we examine the efficacy of a broad-spectrum aquatic disinfectant, Virasure® Aquatic, to induce mortality of L. major propagule stages. We assessed the efficacy of Virasure® Aquatic at contact times of 1, 2 and 5 minutes, using 1% (10g L-1) and 4% (40g L-1) concentrations. A necrosis scale was applied to visually assess tissue degradation. Necrosis increased with longer chemical contact times, with fragment degradation optimised at 2 minutes at 1% concentration and 1 minute at 4% concentration. Mode of application was also critical to treatment effectiveness, with spray treatments less effective than submersion treatments. We recommend the use of Virasure® Aquatic via submersion for a minimum period of 2 minutes at 1% concentration or higher. While spray applications should be applied when submersion is not feasible, such as with large water craft, increased spray times beyond those assessed here should be examined. However, results presented suggest that Virasure® Aquatic can effectively reduce the secondary spread of invasive L. major, and may thus form an integral part of biosecurity protocols. The use of broad-spectrum disinfectants and other readily available treatments, that were not purposefully developed for aquatic AIS control but nevertheless are emerging as effective in aquatic AIS management, is discussed and encouraged.",Aquatic disinfectant | Biosecurity | Invasive species management | Macrophyte | Potassium peroxymonosulfate | Spread prevention,7,1,,2015-NC-MS-4,National Engineering College

Functional Ecology © 2018 British Ecological Society A combination of timing of and body condition (i.e., mass) at arrival on the breeding grounds interact to influence the optimal combination of the timing of reproduction and clutch size in migratory species. This relationship has been formalized by Rowe et al. in a condition-dependent individual optimization model (American Naturalist, 1994, 143, 689-722), which has been empirically tested and validated in avian species with a capital-based breeding strategy. This model makes a key, but currently untested prediction; that variation in the rate of body condition gain will shift the optimal combination of laying date and clutch size. This prediction is essential because it implies that individuals can compensate for the challenges associated with late timing of arrival or poor body condition at arrival on the breeding grounds through adjustment of their life history investment decisions, in an attempt to maximize fitness. Using an 11-year data set in arctic-nesting common eiders (Somateria mollissima), quantification of fattening rates using plasma triglycerides (an energetic metabolite), and a path analysis approach, we test this prediction of this optimization model; controlling for arrival date and body condition, females that fatten more quickly will adjust the optimal combination of lay date and clutch size, in favour of a larger clutch size. As predicted, females fattening at higher rates initiated clutches earlier and produced larger clutch sizes, indicating that fattening rate is an important factor in addition to arrival date and body condition in predicting individual variation in reproductive investment. However, there was no direct effect of fattening rate on clutch size (i.e., birds laying on the same date had similar clutch sizes, independent of their fattening rate). Instead, fattening rate indirectly affected clutch size via earlier lay dates, thus not supporting the original predictions of the optimization model. Our results demonstrate that variation in the rate of condition gain allows individuals to shift flexibly along the seasonal decline in clutch size to presumably optimize the combination of laying date and clutch size.

However, conditions during transport – an early stage of the invasion – can be particularly harsh, thereby greatly reducing the size of a population available to establish in a new region. Some successful non-indigenous species are more tolerant of environmental and anthropogenic stressors than related native species, possibly stemming from selection (ie survival of only pre-adapted individuals for particular environmental conditions) during the invasion process. By reviewing current literature concerning population genetics and consequences of selection on population fitness, we propose that selection acting on transported populations can facilitate local adaptation, which may result in a greater likelihood of invasion than predicted by propagule pressure alone.

Beneficial use of fish consumption was designated impaired in the 1980s in many Areas of Concern across the North American Great Lakes. Remedial Action Plans have guided the restoration of beneficial use impairments with the goal of delisting the Areas of Concern. Here we present generic re-designation criteria and a three-tier Assessment Framework to assess the status of the fish consumption beneficial use impairments using the Toronto and Region Area of Concern as a case study. Tier 1 assessment identified that consumption advisories for many resident fish on the Toronto waterfront are non-restrictive (8+ meals month−1). Advisory assessments in Tier 1 found that most migratory fish species, Carp and White Sucker are still restrictive in some cases preventing a ‘not impaired’ re-designation. Tier 2 Comparison with Reference Sites found that the advisories for most local fish are either non-restrictive or similar to reference locations in Lake Ontario, but some advisories due to elevated levels of polychlorinated biphenyl are still more restrictive for the Toronto waterfront and do not favour a ‘not impaired’ re-designation. An evaluation of multiple lines of evidence in Tier 3 including fish contaminant trend analyses, time to reach target fish levels, sediment concentrations and fish consumption patterns resulted in outcomes ranging from neutral (not conclusive) to not impaired. As a precautionary approach, the impaired status of the beneficial use impairment should be maintained to ensure continued polychlorinated biphenyl declines in fish. It is recommended that the Remedial Action Plan team update the fish consumption survey, investigate where additional feasible actions can be taken including examining potential polychlorinated biphenyl sources on the Humber and Don Rivers, and collect new data to undertake a future assessment.",Area of Concern | eating fish | mercury | PCB,4,0,,undefined,

Journal of Evolutionary Biology © 2018 European Society For Evolutionary Biology Given the important role that animal vocalizations play in mate attraction and resource defence, acoustic signals are expected to play a significant role in speciation. Most studies, however, have focused on the acoustic traits of male animals living in the temperate zone. In contrast to temperate environments, in the tropics, it is commonplace for both sexes to produce complex acoustic signals. Therefore, tropical birds offer the opportunity to compare the sexes and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the evolution of animal signals. In this study, we quantified patterns of acoustic variation in Rufous-and-white Wrens (Thryophilus rufalbus) from five populations in Central America. We quantified similarities and differences between male and female songs by comparing the role that acoustic adaptation, cultural isolation and neutral genetic divergence have played in shaping acoustic divergence. We found that males and females showed considerable acoustic variation across populations, although females exhibited greater population divergence than males. Redundancy analysis and partial-redundancy analysis revealed significant relationships between acoustic variation and ecological variables, genetic distance, and geographic distance. Both ambient background noise and geographic distance explained a high proportion of variance for both males and females, suggesting that both acoustic adaptation and cultural isolation influence song. Overall, our results indicate that parallel evolutionary forces act on male and female acoustic signals and highlight the important role that cultural drift and selection play in the evolution of both male and female songs.",acoustic adaptation | cultural drift | female song | genetic drift | geographic variation,0,0,,undefined,Canada Foundation for Innovation

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. It is well established that circulating maternal stress hormones (glucocorticoids, GCs) can alter offspring phenotype. There is also a growing body of empirical work, within ecology and evolution, indicating that maternal GCs link the environment experienced by the mother during gestation with changes in offspring phenotype. These changes are considered to be adaptive if the maternal environment matches the offspring's environment and maladaptive if it does not. While these ideas are conceptually sound, we lack a testable framework that can be used to investigate the fitness costs and benefits of altered offspring phenotypes across relevant future environments. We present error management theory as the foundation for a framework that can be used to assess the adaptive potential of maternal stress hormones on offspring phenotype across relevant postnatal scenarios. To encourage rigorous testing of our framework, we provide field-testable hypotheses regarding the potential adaptive role of maternal stress across a diverse array of taxa and life histories, as well as suggestions regarding how our framework might provide insight into past, present, and future research. This perspective provides an informed lens through which to design and interpret experiments on the effects of maternal stress, provides a framework for predicting and testing variation in maternal stress across and within taxa, and also highlights how rapid environmental change that induces maternal stress may lead to evolutionary traps.",developmental plasticity | maternal effects | maternal programming | maternal stress effects | predictive adaptive responses | signal detection theory,5,1,BIO,IOS-1456655,Directorate for Biological Sciences

Evolutionary Applications published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd Genetic taxonomic assignment can be more sensitive than morphological taxonomic assignment, particularly for small, cryptic or rare species. Sequence processing is essential to taxonomic assignment, but can also produce errors because optimal parameters are not known a priori. Here, we explored how sequence processing parameters influence taxonomic assignment of 18S sequences from bulk zooplankton samples produced by 454 pyrosequencing. We optimized a sequence processing pipeline for two common research goals, estimation of species richness and early detection of aquatic invasive species (AIS), and then tested most optimal models’ performances through simulations. We tested 1,050 parameter sets on 18S sequences from 20 AIS to determine optimal parameters for each research goal. We tested optimized pipelines’ performances (detectability and sensitivity) by computationally inoculating sequences of 20 AIS into ten bulk zooplankton samples from ports across Canada. We found that optimal parameter selection generally depends on the research goal. However, regardless of research goal, we found that metazoan 18S sequences produced by 454 pyrosequencing should be trimmed to 375–400 bp and sequence quality filtering should be relaxed (1.5 ≤ maximum expected error ≤ 3.0, Phred score = 10). Clustering and denoising were only viable for estimating species richness, because these processing steps made some species undetectable at low sequence abundances which would not be useful for early detection of AIS. With parameter sets optimized for early detection of AIS, 90% of AIS were detected with fewer than 11 target sequences, regardless of whether clustering or denoising was used. Despite developments in next-generation sequencing, sequence processing remains an important issue owing to difficulties in balancing false-positive and false-negative errors in metabarcoding data.",aquatic invasive species | biomonitoring | clustering | high-throughput sequencing | metabarcoding | sequence processing,5,1,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Top-predatory wildlife may continue to use such sites as the habitat often appears suitable, and thus bioaccumulate POPs and other contaminants with potential consequences on their health and fitness. Victoria and Esquimalt harbours are located on southern Vancouver Island, British Columbia (BC) and are federally designated contaminated sites due mainly to past heavy industrial activities, such as from shipyards and sawmills. We collected scat samples from river otters (Lontra canadensis) throughout an annual cycle, and combined chemical analysis with DNA genotyping to examine whether the harbour areas constituted a contaminant-induced ecological trap for otters. We confirmed spatial habitat use by radio telemetry of a subsample of otters. Fifteen percent of otter scat contained PCB concentrations exceeding levels considered to have adverse effects on the reproduction of mink (Neovison vison), and there were significant positive correlations between concentrations of PCBs and of thyroid (T3) and sex (progesterone) hormones in fecal samples. Radio telemetry data revealed that otters did not show directional movement away from the harbours, indicating their inability to recognize the contaminated site as a degraded habitat. However, analysis and modeling of the DNA genotyping data provided no evidence that the harbour otters formed a sink population and therefore were in an ecological trap. Despite the highly POP-contaminated habitat, river otters did not appear to be adversely impacted at the population level. Our study demonstrates the value of combining chemical and biological technologies with ecological theory to investigate practical conservation problems. River otters inhabiting highly contaminated harbours showed potential physiological compromises due to PCB exposure. Despite their home ranges being restricted within the contaminated areas, otters did not appear to be adversely impacted at the population level.",Coastal contaminated sites | Ecological trap | Fecal DNA genotyping | Hormone response | Persistent organic pollutants | River otter,7,1,,undefined,Environment and Climate Change Canada

Perennial rivers and streams make a disproportionate contribution to global carbon (C) cycling. However, the contribution of intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES), which sometimes cease to flow and can dry completely, is largely ignored although they represent over half the global river network. Substantial amounts of terrestrial plant litter (TPL) accumulate in dry riverbeds and, upon rewetting, this material can undergo rapid microbial processing. We present the results of a global research collaboration that collected and analysed TPL from 212 dry riverbeds across major environmental gradients and climate zones. We assessed litter decomposability by quantifying the litter carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and oxygen (O2) consumption in standardized assays and estimated the potential short-term CO2 emissions during rewetting events. Aridity, cover of riparian vegetation, channel width and dry-phase duration explained most variability in the quantity and decomposability of plant litter in IRES. Our estimates indicate that a single pulse of CO2 emission upon litter rewetting contributes up to 10% of the daily CO2 emission from perennial rivers and stream, particularly in temperate climates. This indicates that the contributions of IRES should be included in global C-cycling assessments.",,14,0,,undefined,

All rights reserved. The genus Beroe Browne, 1756 (Ctenophora, Beroidae) occurs worldwide, with 25 currently-described species. Because the genus is poorly studied, the definitive number of species is uncertain. Recently, a possible new Beroe species was suggested based on internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS1) sequences from samples collected in Svalbard, Norway. Another species, Beroe ovata, was introduced to Europe from North America, initially in the Black Sea and subsequently (and possibly secondarily) into the Mediterranean and Baltic Seas. In areas where ctenophores have been introduced, they have often had significant detrimental ecological effects. The potential for other cryptic and/or undescribed Beroe species and history of spread of some species in the genus give reason for additional study. When alive, morphological hallmarks may be challenging to spot and photograph owing to the animals' transparency and near-constant motion. We sampled and analyzed 109 putative Beroe specimens from Europe, using morphological and molecular approaches. DNA analyses were conducted using cytochrome oxidase 1 and internal transcribed spacer sequences and, together with published sequences from GenBank, phylogenetic relationships of the genus were explored. Our study suggests the presence of at least 5 genetic lineages of Beroe in Europe, of which 3 could be assigned to known species: Beroe gracilis Künne 1939; Beroe cucumis Fabricius, 1780; and Beroe ovata sensu Mayer, 1912. The other 2 lineages (here provisionally named Beroe ""norvegica"" and Beroe ""anatoliensis"") did not clearly coincide with any known species and might therefore reflect new species, but confirmation of this requires further study.",cytochrome oxidase (COI) | DNA barcoding | gelatinous zooplankton | internal transcribed spacer (ITS) | invasive species,0,0,,0149-2018-0009,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

The model was validated by comparing observed with predicted Hg and PCB 180 concentrations across 5 age classes from 5 different waterbodies across North America. The non–steady-state model generated accurate predictions for Hg and PCB bioaccumulation in 3 of 5 waterbodies: Apsey Lake (ON, Canada), Sharbot Lake (ON, Canada), and Stonelick Lake (OH, USA). The poor performance of the model for the Detroit River (MI, USA/ON, Canada) and Lake Hartwell (GA/SC, USA), which are 2 well-known contaminated sites with possibly high heterogeneity in spatial contamination, was attributed to changes in feeding behavior and/or prey contamination. Model simulations indicate that growth dilution is a major component of contaminant bioaccumulation patterns in fish, especially during early life stages, and was predicted to be more important for hydrophobic PCBs than for Hg. Simulations that considered tissue-specific growth provided some improvement in model performance particularly for PCBs in fish populations that exhibited changes in their whole-body lipid content with age. Higher variation in lipid growth compared with that of lean dry protein was also observed between different bluegill populations, which partially explains the greater variation in PCB bioaccumulation slopes compared with Hg across sampling sites.

The globally invasive Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) was introduced to the Great Lakes around 1990, spreading widely and becoming the dominant benthic fish in many areas. The speed and scope of this invasion is remarkable and calls into question conventional secondary spread models and scenarios. We utilized nine microsatellites to identify large-scale genetic structure in Round Goby populations in the eastern Great Lakes, and assessed the role of colonization vs. secondary transport and dispersal in developing this structure. We identified three clusters, corresponding with Lake Huron, eastern Lake Erie, and western Lake Erie plus eastern Lake Ontario, along with three highly divergent populations. Bottleneck analysis identified founder effects in two divergent populations. Regression analyses of isolation by distance and allelic richness vs. distance from the initial invasion site were consistent with limited migration. However, some populations in eastern Lake Erie and Lake Ontario showed anomalously low genetic distance from the original site of colonization, consistent with secondary transport of large numbers of individuals via ballast water. We conclude that genetic structure of Round Goby in the Great Lakes principally resulted from long-distance secondary transport via ballast water with additional movement of individual via bait buckets and natural dispersal. The success of Round Gobies represents an interesting model for colonization characterization; however, those same attributes present significant challenges for conservation and fisheries management. Current management likely prevents many new species from arriving in the Great Lakes, but fails to address the transport of species within the lakes after they arrive; this is an issue of clear and pressing importance.",,3,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Abstract: In many tropical birds, both sexes use conspicuous vocal signals during territorial interactions. Although a growing number of studies examine male and female signals in the context of coordinated vocal duets, the use of vocal signals by both sexes in non-duetting species is poorly documented, even though these species are more numerous than duetting species. Furthermore, few studies of tropical non-duetting species test for seasonal variation in signaling behavior. We studied season-specific and sex-specific variation in signaling behavior of a tropical resident songbird, the Rufous-capped Warbler (Basileuterus rufifrons), by conducting a playback experiment where we simulated conspecific territorial intruders producing three types of vocalizations (male songs, female calls, or a “pair” with simultaneous male songs and female calls) and a heterospecific control. We repeated playback during the pre-breeding and breeding seasons. Response intensity to playback varied with season and sex of the focal birds. During the pre-breeding season, both sexes showed strong physical approach responses and vocal responses to all conspecific intrusions, especially paired intrusions. During the breeding season, males responded strongly to all conspecific treatments, whereas females showed little response. Although females primarily used calls in response to conspecific playback, many females also sang, especially during the non-breeding season. Our results therefore suggest that both male and female signals are used for shared territory defense, but that the contributions of each sex to territory defense vary seasonally. Our results also contribute to our understanding of the evolution of combined male and female signaling during territory defense. Significance statement: In resident tropical animals, both males and females often use conspicuous signals during territorial interactions with conspecifics. Seasonal and sex-specific variation in vocal behavior of tropical resident birds during these territorial interactions has received little research attention. We conducted a playback experiment to investigate season- and sex-specific variation in signaling behavior of tropical Rufous-capped Warblers (B. rufifrons). In the pre-breeding season, both sexes responded strongly to all conspecific intrusions, especially paired intrusions, by approaching the playback speakers and vocalizing. In the breeding season, males actively defended the territory alone whereas females rarely responded. Our results suggest that both sexes of Rufous-capped Warbler use vocal signals for shared territory defense, although the contributions of each sex to territory defense differ seasonally.",Female signals | Female song | Mate competition | Rufous-capped Warbler | Stereo playback experiment | Territory defense,2,0,,undefined,Agency for Defense Development

Individuals may also share syntactical rules that govern the transitions between different song types, but few studies have attempted to study this kind of sharing. Progress has been inhibited by a lack of statistical tools to compare song-type transitions among individuals. We present a straightforward method for comparing song transitions based on Markov transition matrices. The method calculates the number of mutually preferred song-type-to-different-song-type transitions found in the song sequences of two birds, then assesses whether that number is significantly greater than would be expected if the two birds ordered their songs independently of one another. We applied this method to song sequences from five songbird species. All pairwise comparisons among male Cassin's vireos, Vireo cassinii, showed significant similarity in song transitions, as did a minority of comparisons among Adelaide's warblers, Setophaga adelaidae, and one pair of marsh wrens, Cistothorus palustris. In contrast, dyads of rock wrens, Salpinctes obsoletus, and rufous-and-white wrens, Thryophilus rufalbus, did not share song-type transitions at levels exceeding chance. Interterritory distance was not significantly related to our measure of song transition similarity in any of our study species. These results provide evidence that interindividual similarity in song-type transitions is a trait that varies considerably among species. We discuss the potential drivers of similarity in song transitions, but note that assessing its evolutionary breadth will require a larger sample of species. The application of our method to additional species will provide a more comprehensive understanding of signal use and vocal interaction in songbirds.",Adelaide's warbler | birdsong | Cassin's vireo | marsh wren | rock wren | rufous-and-white wren | syntax,2,0,,1125423,National Science Foundation

At temperatures exceeding 31 °C, tubenose goby demonstrated significantly higher mortalities and shorter times to death relative to round goby. The observed differences in thermal tolerance were consistent with differences in the native geographic ranges observed for each species at their southern ranges. The observed differences in physiological performance combined with species differences in other life history traits such body size, reproduction, feeding ecology and habitat affiliation may also explain differences in the invasiveness experienced by these two Great Lakes invasive fish including a greater ability of round gobies to occupy extreme habitats with large water temperature fluctuations.",Aquatic invasive species | Fundamental niche | Gobiidae | Respirometry | Thermal tolerance,0,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Seabirds as meso to top predators can accumulate high quantities of Hg through diet. Reproduction is one of the most sensitive endpoints of Hg toxicity in marine birds. Yet, few studies have explored Hg exposure and effects in Antarctic seabirds, where increasing environmental perturbations challenge animal populations. This study focuses on the Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica from Svarthamaren, Antarctica, where the world's largest breeding population is thought to be in decline. Hg and the stable isotopes of carbon (δ13C, proxy of feeding habitat) and nitrogen (δ15N, trophic position/diet) were measured in red blood cells from 266 individuals over two breeding years (2012–13, 2013–14). Our aims were to 1) quantify the influence of individual traits (size and sex) and feeding ecology (foraging location, δ13C and δ15N values) on Hg exposure, and 2) test the relationship between Hg concentrations with body condition and breeding output (hatching success and chick survival). Hg concentrations in Antarctic petrels (mean ± SD, 0.84 ± 0.25, min-max, 0.42–2.71 μg g−1 dw) were relatively low when compared to other Antarctic seabirds. Hg concentrations increased significantly with δ15N values, indicating that individuals with a higher trophic level (i.e. feeding more on fish) had higher Hg exposure. By contrast, Hg exposure was not driven by feeding habitat (inferred from both foraging location and δ13C values), suggesting that Hg transfer to predators in Antarctic waters is relatively homogeneous over a large geographical scale. Hg concentrations were not related to body condition, hatching date and short-term breeding output. At present, Hg exposure is likely not of concern for this population. Nevertheless, further studies on other fitness parameters and long-term breeding output are warranted because Hg can have long-term population-level effects without consequences on current breeding success. Blood Hg concentrations in Antarctic petrels were driven by trophic position and were not related to short-term breeding output.",Antarctica | Bioaccumulation | Body condition | Breeding success | Stable isotopes | Trophic position,6,0,IUF,undefined,Institut Universitaire de France

We evaluated effects of Southern Oscillation Index (SOI) and local temperature and rainfall at multiple temporal scales on sex-specific survival of a resident tropical bird, the rufous-and-white wren Thryophilus rufalbus, studied over 15 years in the dry forests of northwestern Costa Rica. We found that annual apparent survival of males was 8% higher than females, more variable over time, and responded more strongly to environmental variation than female survival, which did not vary strongly with SOI or local weather. For males, mean and maximum local temperatures were better predictors of survival than either rainfall or SOI, with high temperatures during the dry season and early wet season negatively influencing survival. These results suggest that, even for species adapted to hot environments, further temperature increases may threaten the persistence of local populations in the absence of distributional shifts.",Climate change | Population dynamics | Seasonality | Southern Oscillation Index | Thryophilus rufalbus | Thryothorus rufalbus,1,1,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

However, relatively limited knowledge exists on their abundance in the edible portion of a variety of Great Lakes fish to aid in understanding their potential risk to human consumers. We studied levels, patterns, trends and significance of PCNs in a total 470 fillet samples of 18 fish species collected from the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes between 2006 and 2013. A limited comparison of fillet and wholebody concentrations in Carp and Bullhead was also conducted. The ∑ PCN ranged from 0.006–6.7 ng/g wet weight (ww) and 0.15–190 ng/g lipid weight (lw) with the dominant congeners being PCN-52/60 (34%), -42 (21%) and -66/67 (15%). The concentrations spatially varied in the order of the Detroit River > Lakes Erie > Ontario > Huron > Superior. PCN-66/67 was the dominating congener contributing on average 76–80% of toxic equivalent concentration (TEQPCN). Contribution of TEQPCN to TEQTotal (TEQDioxins + Furans + dioxin-likePCBs + PCNs) was mostly < 15%, especially at higher TEQTotal, and PCB-126 remains the major congener contributing to TEQTotal. The congener pattern suggests that impurities in PCB formulations and thereby historical PCB contamination, instead of unintentional releases from industrial thermal processes, could be an important source of PCNs in Great Lakes fish. A limited temporal change analysis indicated declines in the levels of PCN-66/67 between 2006 and 2012, complemented by previously reported decrease in PCNs in Lake Ontario Lake Trout between 1979 and 2004. The whole body concentrations were 1.4–3.2 fold higher than the corresponding fillets of Carp and Bullhead. Overall, the study results suggest that only targeted monitoring of PCNs in Great Lakes fish, especially at the Detroit River, Lake Erie and Lake Ontario, is necessary to assess continued future improvements of this group of contaminants of concern.",Fish consumption | Great Lakes | Polychlorinated naphthalene PCN | Spatial and temporal trends,2,0,,COA2045,Government of Ontario

A fundamental hypothesis about vocal learning is that young animals learn vocalizations in their natal areas and, following postnatal dispersal, they may introduce new types of vocalizations into their breeding areas. We tested this hypothesis in a tropical bird, the Rufous-and-white Wren (Thryophilus rufalbus), a species in which both sexes produce learned songs. We collected blood samples and acoustic recordings from 146 adult wrens from 3 populations in northwestern Costa Rica. We genotyped individuals at 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci and identified first-generation migrants using partial Bayesian genotype assignment. We quantified acoustic variation by comparing fine-scale acoustic structure, song sharing, and repertoire novelty between residents and first-generation migrants. We found significant population-level differences in acoustic structure of songs among the 3 populations. Of the 146 individuals genotyped, 9 individuals were identified as first-generation migrants. In contrast to our predictions, however, we found that these first-generation migrants did not exhibit differences in the acoustic structure of their songs from resident individuals in their breeding population, either for males or females. We conclude that song learning in first-generation migrants must be behaviorally influenced by birds in their breeding populations, following postnatal dispersal. We observed population-level acoustic differences among the 3 study sites, which implies sustained divergent selection pressures at each site, possibly reflecting acoustic adaptation to different environments or social pressure to sing local songs. Understanding and quantifying patterns of cultural evolution at multiple scales provides insight into how behavioral barriers, such as acoustic signals, contribute to population differentiation and even speciation.","dispersal, immigration, Rufous-and-white Wren, song learning, Thryophilus rufalbus, Thryothorus rufalbus",1,0,,undefined,Government of Ontario

Journal of Applied Ecology © 2018 British Ecological Society Globally, small-scale inshore fisheries are being recognized as highly beneficial for underdeveloped coastal communities since they directly contribute to local economies. Community coastal fisheries, however, may target species that are simultaneously harvested by large commercial vessels in adjacent offshore waters, creating uncertainty over stock units and connectivity that complicate management. Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides, a commercially important flatfish species in the Arctic, were tagged in Scott Inlet, coastal Baffin Island, Canada, with acoustic transmitters and tracked for a 1-year period. Our aim was to measure fish movement and connectivity between inshore habitats, where Inuit fisheries are developing, and offshore waters, where an established commercial fishery operates. Four movement metrics were established, and cluster analysis and a mixed effects model were used to define movement types and identify environmental covariates of the presence/absence within the coastal environment respectively. Two distinct movement patterns were characterized for Greenland halibut; the majority were transients that were no longer detected inshore by the end of November (n = 47, 72%), and a smaller group of intermittently resident fish that moved into the offshore at the same time as transient fish, but returned to the coastal environment in the winter (n = 8, 12%), with the remainder being undefined. The presence of Greenland halibut in the inshore was negatively correlated with ice cover, indicating that fish moved offshore as sea ice formed. Synthesis and applications. Greenland halibut were previously thought to be highly resident within the coastal environment of Baffin Bay; however, our data demonstrates that this is not true for all areas. In Scott Inlet and adjacent coastal regions, Greenland halibut exhibit complex inshore-offshore connectivity, suggesting inshore and offshore fisheries require a shared quota. We recommend that in the face of developing global small-scale coastal fisheries, improved understanding of stock connectivity between environments is required to sustainably manage commercial fish species.",Arctic | coastal | commercial fish | fisheries management | flatfish | Greenland halibut | inshore-offshore connectivity | migration | resident | small-scale fisheries,7,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

The paradigm that reduced genetic diversity should limit the evolutionary potential of invasive species, and thus, their potential for range expansion has received little empirical support, possibly due to the choice of genetic markers. Our goal was to test for effects of genetic drift and selection at functional genetic markers as they relate to the invasion success of two paired invasive goby species, one widespread (successful) and one with limited range expansion (less successful). We genotyped fish using two marker types: single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in known-function, protein-coding genes and microsatellites to contrast the effects of neutral genetic processes. We identified reduced allelic variation in the invaded range for the less successful tubenose goby. SNPs putatively under selection were responsible for the observed differences in population structure between marker types for round goby (successful) but not tubenose goby (less successful). A higher proportion of functional loci experienced divergent selection for round goby, suggesting increased evolutionary potential in invaded ranges may be associated with round goby's greater invasion success. Genes involved in thermal tolerance were divergent for round goby populations but not tubenose goby, consistent with the hypothesis that invasion success for fish in temperate regions is influenced by capacity for thermal tolerance.

These interactions make predictions of the ecological response to climate change challenging; however, predictive models are required to effectively manage wildlife populations and conserve biodiversity. Here, we demonstrate how agent-based models (ABMs) can be used to predict population responses under multiple effects of climate change. We consider the case of northern common eiders (Somateria mollissima borealis), a culturally and ecologically important seaduck which is experiencing dramatic environmental change due to losses in Arctic sea ice. Our model shows that losses in Arctic sea ice will lead to increases in nest predation by polar bears in areas where these species are sympatric. However, climate-mediated increases in breeding propensity and clutch size could have a large positive effect on eider population size. When considered together, these effects are predicted to result in a relatively stable eider population size over a 50-year period. Additionally, assuming eider populations are influenced by climate change in the manner proposed in this study, our model suggests that future eider populations will not be more susceptible to extrinsic perturbations (e.g. severe weather events, disease outbreaks) than were historical populations. As a result, our study demonstrates increasing climatic suitability and increasing nest predation will not lead to major changes in population size in northern common eiders, and emphasizes the importance of considering multiple, interacting effects on wildlife populations experiencing climate change.",,2,0,,IT04216,Environment and Climate Change Canada

Bulk stable isotope analysis was used to assess the trophic level and foraging habitats of Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi) compared to three large sympatric predatory teleosts (the Nassau grouper Epinephelus striatus, black grouper Mycteroperca bonaci, and great barracuda Sphyraena barracuda) in an isolated Caribbean coral reef ecosystem. Models and empirical studies have suggested that the depletion of large-bodied sharks in coral reef ecosystems triggers a trophic cascade that could affect the benthic community, favoring algae over coral. The hypothesized cascade is based on the premise that sharks prey on large piscivorous teleost fish that in turn prey on key herbivorous fish. Analysis of nitrogen-stable isotopes (δ15N) from white muscle tissue revealed neither adult or juvenile Caribbean reef sharks were significantly enriched in 15N compared with sympatric predatory teleost species. Linear regression found no evidence of an ontogenetic increase in nitrogen with increasing body size for Caribbean reef sharks; however, there was a significant positive relationship between body size and carbon isotope (δ13C) values. These results suggest that Caribbean reef sharks in isolated systems do not act as the apex predator in coral reef ecosystems primarily feeding on large-bodied sympatric teleosts. Instead, Caribbean reef sharks form part of an upper trophic-level predator guild alongside large-bodied teleosts, which makes the predicted trophic cascade as a result of the removal of reef sharks unlikely. Moreover, the body size–δ13C relationship suggests Caribbean reef sharks exhibit ontogenetic and individual variation in where they feed. The ecological role of this species is, therefore, complex and contextual, similar to carcharhinid species in the Indo-Pacific, emphasizing the need to further elucidate the interactions between reef sharks and the overall coral reef ecosystem so as to best inform effective conservation and management of the species.",,4,0,,7262541,Stony Brook University

To date, our ability to study deep-sea species lags behind that of those inhabiting the photic zone limiting scientific data available for management. In particular, knowledge of horizontal movements is restricted to two locations; capture and recapture, with no temporal information on absolute animal locations between endpoints. To elucidate the horizontal movements of a large deep-sea fish, a novel tagging approach was adopted using the smallest available prototype satellite tag – the mark-report pop-up archival tag (mrPAT). Five Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus) were equipped with multiple mrPATs as well as a standard archival satellite tag (miniPAT) that were programmed to release in sequence at 8–10 day intervals. The performance of the mrPATs was quantified. The tagging approach provided multiple locations per individual and revealed a previously unknown directed migration of Greenland sharks from the Canadian high Arctic to Northwest Greenland. All tags reported locations, however, the accuracy and time from expected release were variable among tags (average time to an accurate location from expected release = 30.8 h, range: 4.9–227.6 h). Average mrPAT drift rate estimated from best quality messages (LQ1,2,3) was 0.37 ± 0.09 m/s indicating tags were on average 41.1 ± 63.4 km (range: 6.5–303.1 km) from the location of the animal when they transmitted. mrPATs provided daily temperature values that were highly correlated among tags and with the miniPAT (70.8% of tag pairs were significant). In contrast, daily tilt sensor data were variable among tags on the same animal (12.5% of tag pairs were significant). Tracking large-scale movements of deep-sea fish has historically been limited by the remote environment they inhabit. The current study provides a new approach to document reliable coarse scale horizontal movements to understand migrations, stock structure and habitat use of large species. Opportunities to apply mrPATs to understand the movements of medium size fish, marine mammals and to validate retrospective movement modeling approaches based on archival data are presented.",Benthic | Deep-sea | Greenland shark | Migration | MiniPAT | mrPAT | Satellite telemetry,3,0,,undefined,Adam Taliaferro Foundation

Stable isotope ecology typically involves sacrificing the animal to obtain tissues. However, with threatened species or in long-term longitudinal studies, non-lethal sampling techniques should be used. The objectives of this study were to (1) determine if caudal fin tissue could be used as a non-lethal proxy to liver and muscle for stable isotope analysis, and (2) assess the effects of ethanol preservation on δ15N and δ13C in fin tissue of juvenile yellow perch Perca flavescens. The δ13C of caudal fin was not significantly different from liver (t23 = −0.58; p = 0.57), and was more correlated with δ15N in liver (r2 = 0.78) than muscle (r2 = 0.56). Ethanol preservation enriched 15N and 13C for caudal fins, but by using our developed regression models, these changes in δ15N and δ13C can now be corrected. Overall, caudal fin tissue is a more reliable proxy to liver than muscle for δ15N and δ13C in yellow perch.",Carbon-13 | caudal fin | liver | muscle | nitrogen-15 | preservation,0,0,,undefined,W.

Management of non-indigenous invasive species (NIS) is challenging owing in part to limitations of early detection and identification. The advent of environmental DNA (eDNA) techniques provides an efficient way to detect NIS when their abundance is extremely low. However, eDNA-based methods often suffer from uncertain detection sensitivity, which requires detailed testing before applying these methods in the field. Here we developed an eDNA tool for early detection of the highly invasive golden mussel, Limnoperna fortunei, based on the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I gene (COI). Further, we tested technical issues, including sampling strategy and detection sensitivity, based on a laboratory experiment. We then applied the method to field samples collected from water bodies in China where this mussel has or is expected to colonize. Results showed that the detection limit varied extensively among our newly developed primer pairs, ranging from 4 × 10 −2 to 4 × 10 −6  ng of total genomic DNA. Laboratory detection was affected by the availability of eDNA (i.e., both mussel abundance and incubation time). Detection capacity was higher in laboratory samples containing re-suspended matter from the bottom layer versus that collected from the surface. Among 25 field sites, detection was 100% at sites with high mussel abundance and as low as 40% at sites with low abundance when tested using our most sensitive primer pair. Early detection of NIS present at low abundance in nature requires not only sensitive primers, but also an optimized sampling strategy to reduce the occurrence of false negatives. Careful selection and detailed testing of primer pairs ensures effective eDNA-based species detection in surveillance and management programs.",eDNA | Golden mussel | Invasive species | Limnoperna fortunei | Primer sensitivity | Sampling strategy,10,0,NSERC,2015DFG71210,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Many zooplankton surveys underestimate species richness owing to difficulties in detecting rare species. This problem is particularly acute for studies designed to detect non-indigenous species (NIS) when their abundance is low. Our goal was to test the difference in detection efficiency between traditional microscopy and image analysis (i.e., FlowCAM). We hypothesized that detection of rare species should become easier as they become abundant in a sample, if they are morphologically distinct, or if counting effort increased. We spiked different densities of Cladocera into zooplankton samples from Lake Ontario to simulate rarity, and assessed detection rate. Our results indicated that there was a positive relationship between the probability of finding at least one spiked NIS and its abundance, distinctiveness, and counting effort employed. FlowCAM processed more subsamples, though morphologically similar taxa were distinguished more readily with microscopy. The expected probability for detecting one individual spiked into a sample with ~ 8000 individuals (300 counted) was 3.60%, though observed values were considerably lower using both classical microscopy (4.58 × 10−3 to 1.00%) and FlowCAM (0.10 to 3.00%). Our experiments highlight that many plankton ecologists use subsample counts too low to detect rare native species and NIS, resulting in low species richness estimates and false negatives.",Early detection | FlowCAM | Great Lakes | Hamilton Harbour | Invasive species | Risk assessment | Taxonomy,2,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Non-native species may be introduced either intentionally or unintentionally, and their impact can range from benign to highly disruptive. Non-native salmonids were introduced into Lake Ontario, Canada, to provide recreational fishing opportunities; however, the establishment of those species has been proposed as a significant barrier to the reintroduction of native Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) due to intense interspecific competition. In this study, we compared population differences of Atlantic salmon in transcriptome response to interspecific competition. We reared Atlantic salmon from two populations (LaHave River and Sebago Lake) with fish of each of three non-native salmonids (Chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, rainbow trout O. mykiss, and brown trout S. trutta) in artificial streams. We used RNA-seq to assess transcriptome differences between the Atlantic salmon populations and the responses of these populations to the interspecific competition treatments after 10 months of competition in the stream tanks. We found that population differences in gene expression were generally greater than the effects of interspecific competition. Interestingly, we found that the two Atlantic salmon populations exhibited similar responses to interspecific competition based on functional gene ontologies, but the specific genes within those ontologies were different. Our transcriptome analyses suggest that the most stressful competitor (as measured by the highest number of differentially expressed genes) differs between the two study populations. Our transcriptome characterization highlights the importance of source population selection for conservation applications, as organisms with different evolutionary histories can possess different transcriptional responses to the same biotic stressors. The results also indicate that generalized predictions of the response of native species to interactions with introduced species may not be appropriate without incorporating potential population-specific response to introduced species.",gene expression | interspecific competition | non-native species | reintroduction | RNA-Seq | salmonids,1,1,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Sharks are a diverse group of mobile predators that forage across varied spatial scales and have the potential to influence food web dynamics. The ecological consequences of recent declines in shark biomass may extend across broader geographic ranges if shark taxa display common behavioural traits. By tracking the original site of photosynthetic fixation of carbon atoms that were ultimately assimilated into muscle tissues of 5,394 sharks from 114 species, we identify globally consistent biogeographic traits in trophic interactions between sharks found in different habitats. We show that populations of shelf-dwelling sharks derive a substantial proportion of their carbon from regional pelagic sources, but contain individuals that forage within additional isotopically diverse local food webs, such as those supported by terrestrial plant sources, benthic production and macrophytes.

We outbred a domesticated aquaculture stock of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha (Walbaum in Artedi, 1792)) with seven wild stocks from British Columbia, Canada. We then examined how functionally related traits underlying energy management – diel variation in cortisol and foraging, social, and movement behaviours — predicted stock-level variation in growth during the freshwater life history stage, which is a performance metric under aquaculture selection. Outbreeding generated significant variation in diel cortisol secretion and behaviours across stocks, and these traits co-varied, suggesting tight integration despite hybridization. The coupling of nighttime cortisol exposure with the daytime behavioural phenotype was the strongest predictor of stock-level variation in body mass. Our results suggest that selection for an integrated phenotype rather than on a single mechanistic trait alone can generate the greatest effect on aquaculture fish growth under outbreeding practices. Furthermore, selecting for these traits at the stock level may increase efficiency of farming methods designed to consistently maximize fish performance on a large scale.",,1,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Journal of Evolutionary Biology © 2017 European Society For Evolutionary Biology Post-copulatory sexual selection processes, including sperm competition and cryptic female choice (CFC), can operate based on major histocompatibility (MH) genes. We investigated sperm competition between male alternative reproductive tactics [jack (sneaker) and hooknose (guard)] of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Using a full factorial design, we examined in vitro competitive fertilization success of paired jack and hooknose males at three time points after sperm activation (0, 15 and 60 s) to test for male competition, CFC and time effects on male fertilization success. We also examined egg-mediated CFC at two MH genes by examining both the relationship between competitive fertilization success and MH divergence as well as inheritance patterns of MH alleles in resulting offspring. We found that jacks sired more offspring than hooknose males at 0 s post-activation; however, jack fertilization success declined over time post-activation, suggesting a trade-off between sperm speed and longevity. Enhanced fertilization success of jacks (presumably via higher sperm quality) may serve to increase sneaker tactic competitiveness relative to dominant hooknose males. We also found evidence of egg-mediated CFC (i.e. female × male interaction) influencing competitive fertilization success; however, CFC was not acting on the MH genes as we found no relationship between fertilization success and MH II β1 or MH I α1 divergence and we found no deviations from Mendelian inheritance of MH alleles in the offspring. Our study provides insight into evolutionary mechanisms influencing variation in male mating success within alternative reproductive tactics, thus underscoring different strategies that males can adopt to attain success.",cryptic female choice | fertilization success | hooknose | jack | post-copulatory | sexual selection,3,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

The influence of anthropogenic noise on freshwater fish can be quantified using the same methods as with marine species — through measuring changes in behavioural and physiological outputs. Here, we briefly review the literature regarding behavioural and physiological impacts of noise pollution on freshwater fish and further note the lack of incorporation of both behavioural and physiological measures within current studies. We call for an increased research emphasis on possible effects of anthropogenic noise on freshwater fish and further suggest that the integration of behavioural and physiological techniques is critical for a full understanding of these effects.

The breeding biology of most tropical resident bird species is little-documented, particularly for sexually monomorphic species in which sex-specific contributions to nest-building and nestling provisioning are challenging to quantify. We describe nest structure and adult behavior throughout the nesting cycle for a color-banded population of Rufous-capped Warblers (Basileuterus rufifrons), a widespread sexually monomorphic tropical resident songbird. Using focal observations of 11 nests, combined with video monitoring during the incubation and nestling periods, we provide new information on this species' nesting behavior, particularly sex-specific parental contributions to nestbuilding, incubation, and nestling care. All nests were dome-shaped structures with a side entrance constructed of grasses, twigs, and leaves, as is typical for Basileuterus warblers. Females were the primary nest-builders, although we also observed male-assisted nest-building at one nest, which is a rare behavior in wood-warblers. Females were the sole incubators, and the incubation period in this population was 13-14 days. Video recordings confirmed that males and females made equivalent contributions to nestling feeding and nest sanitation.

The wood-warblers (family Parulidae) are a diverse family of songbirds in which males of many migratory species use different song types or patterns of song delivery (known as ‘singing modes’) depending on context. The vocal behaviour of most tropical resident warblers remains undescribed, although these species differ ecologically and behaviourally from migratory species, and may therefore differ in their vocal behaviour. We test whether male Rufous-capped Warblers Basileuterus rufifrons use distinct singing modes by examining song structure and context-dependent variation in their songs. We recorded multiple song bouts from 50 male Warblers in a Costa Rican population over 3 years to describe seasonal, diel and annual variation in song structure and vocal behaviour. We found that Rufous-capped Warbler songs are complex, with many syllable types shared both within and between males’ repertoires. Males varied their song output depending on context: they sang long songs at a high rate at dawn and during the breeding season, and shortened songs in the presence of a vocalizing female mate. Unlike many migratory species, Rufous-capped Warblers do not appear to have different singing modes; they did not change the song variants used or the pattern of song delivery according to time of day, season or female vocal activity.

Variation in gene transcription is widely believed to be the mechanistic basis of phenotypically plastic traits; however, comparatively little is known about the inheritance patterns of transcriptional variation that would allow us to predict its response to selection. In addition, acclimation to different environmental conditions influences acute transcriptional responses to stress and it is unclear if these effects are heritable. To address these gaps in knowledge, we assayed levels of messenger RNA for 14 candidate genes at rest and in response to a 24-h confinement stress for 72 half-sib families of Chinook salmon reared in two different environments (hatchery and semi-natural stream channel). We observed extensive plasticity for mRNA levels of metabolic and stress response genes and demonstrated that mRNA level plasticity due to rearing environment affects mRNA level plasticity in response to stress. These effects have important implications for natural populations experiencing multiple stressors. We identified genotype-by-environment interactions for mRNA levels that were dominated by maternal effects; however, mRNA level response to challenge also exhibited a non-Additive genetic basis. Our results indicate that while plasticity for mRNA levels can evolve, predicting the outcome of selection will be difficult. The inconsistency in genetic architecture among treatment groups suggests there is considerable cryptic genetic variation for gene expression.",,1,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

In this study, we explored interspecific competition effects on the gut microbiota of two Atlantic salmon populations (LaHave and Sebago) resulting from four non-native salmonids. After 10 months of rearing in semi-natural stream tanks under six interspecific competition treatments, we characterized the gut microbiota of 178 Atlantic salmon by parallel sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. We found 3978 bacterial OTUs across all samples. Microbiota alpha diversity and abundance of 27 OTUs significantly differed between the two populations. Interspecific competition reduced relative abundance of potential beneficial bacteria (six genera of lactic acid bacteria) as well as 13 OTUs, but only in the LaHave population, indicating population-specific competition effects.

For over a century, physiological tools and techniques have been allowing researchers to characterize how organisms respond to changes in their natural environment and how they interact with human activities or infrastructure. Over time, many of these techniques have become part of the conservation physiology toolbox, which is used to monitor, predict, conserve, and restore plant and animal populations under threat. Here, we provide a summary of the tools that currently comprise the conservation physiology toolbox. By assessing patterns in articles that have been published in 'Conservation Physiology' over the past 5 years that focus on introducing, refining and validating tools, we provide an overview of where researchers are placing emphasis in terms of taxa and physiological sub-disciplines. Although there is certainly diversity across the toolbox, metrics of stress physiology (particularly glucocorticoids) and studies focusing on mammals have garnered the greatest attention, with both comprising the majority of publications ( > 45%). We also summarize the types of validations that are actively being completed, including those related to logistics (sample collection, storage and processing), interpretation of variation in physiological traits and relevance for conservation science. Finally, we provide recommendations for future tool refinement, with suggestions for: (i) improving our understanding of the applicability of glucocorticoid physiology; (ii) linking multiple physiological and non-physiological tools; (iii) establishing a framework for plant conservation physiology; (iv) assessing links between environmental disturbance, physiology and fitness; (v) appreciating opportunities for validations in underrepresented taxa; and (vi) emphasizing tool validation as a core component of research programmes. Overall, we are confident that conservation physiology will continue to increase its applicability to more taxa, develop more non-invasive techniques, delineate where limitations exist, and identify the contexts necessary for interpretation in captivity and the wild.",Biomarker | Glucocorticoid | Techniques | Tools | Validation,10,1,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Determining how environmental conditions interact with individual intrinsic properties is important for unravelling the underlying mechanisms that drive variation in reproductive decisions among migratory species. We investigated the influence of sea ice conditions and body condition at arrival on the breeding propensity, i.e. the decision to reproduce or not within a single breeding season, and timing of laying in migrating common eiders (Somateria mollissima) breeding in the Arctic. Using Radarsat satellite images acquired from 2002 to 2013, we estimated the proportion of open water in the intertidal zone in early summer to track the availability of potential foraging areas for pre-breeding females. Timing of ice-breakup varied by up to 20 days across years and showed strong relationship with both breeding propensity and the timing of laying of eiders: fewer pre-breeding individuals were resighted nesting in the colony and laying was also delayed in years with late ice-breakup. Interestingly, the effect of sea ice dynamics on reproduction was modulated by the state of individuals at arrival on the breeding grounds: females arriving in low condition were more affected by a late ice-breakup. Open water accessibility in early summer, a likely proxy of food availability, is thus crucial for reproductive decisions in a (partial) capital breeder. Our predictive capacity in determining how Arctic-breeding seabirds respond to changes in environmental conditions will require incorporating such cross-seasonal cumulative effects.",Breeding propensity | Common eider | Individual state | Reproductive decisions | Sea ice,6,0,FQRNT,CRC,Fonds Québécois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies

MaE (3d cultured) caused a reduction of fertilization (35.4%) and hatching (15.5%) rates, and increased mortality rates (≤90.0%) and malformation rate (27.6%), typically accompanied by heart failure. Proteomics analysis revealed that two greatest changed proteins – protein S100A1 (over-expressed 26 times compared with control) and myosin light chain (under-expressed 25 fold) – are closely associated with heart function. Further study revealed that heart failure was due to calcium ion imbalance and malformed cardiac structure.

Vessel noise is a known anthropogenic disturbance, but its effects on Arctic fish are largely unknown. Using acoustic telemetry — Vemco positioning system — we quantified the home ranges and fine-scale movement types (MT) of shorthorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus scorpius), a common benthic Arctic fish, in response to vessels and environmental drivers during open water over 3 years (2012–2014). Low overlap of core home ranges (50%) for all years and a change of overall MT proportions (significant in 2012 only) were observed when vessels were present compared with absent. However, changes in MTs associated with vessel presence were not consistent between years. Photoperiod was the only environmental driver that influenced (R2 = 0.32) MTs of sculpin. This is the first study of vessel impacts on Arctic fish using acoustic telemetry and demonstrates that individuals alter their behavior and home ranges when vessels are present. Given increasing vessel traffic in the Arctic, additional study on the impact of vessels on these ecosystems is warranted.",,2,0,,undefined,Adam Taliaferro Foundation

Dickey et al. Invasive alien species (IAS) cause myriad negative impacts, such as ecosystem disruption, human, animal and plant health issues, economic damage and species extinctions. There are many sources of emerging and future IAS, such as the poorly regulated international pet trade. However, we lack methodologies to predict the likely ecological impacts and invasion risks of such IAS which have little or no informative invasion history. This study develops the Relative Impact Potential (RIP) metric, a new measure of ecological impact that incorporates per capita functional responses (FRs) and proxies for numerical responses (NRs) associated with emerging invaders. Further, as propagule pressure is a determinant of invasion risk, we combine the new measure of Pet Propagule Pressure (PPP) with RIP to arrive at a second novel metric, Relative Invasion Risk (RIR). We present methods to calculate these metrics and to display the outputs on intuitive bi- and triplots. We apply RIP/RIR to assess the potential ecological impacts and invasion risks of four commonly traded pet turtles that represent emerging IAS: Trachemys scripta scripta, the yellow-bellied slider; T. s. troostii, the Cumberland slider; Sternotherus odoratus, the common musk turtle; and Kinosternon subrubrum, the Eastern mud turtle. The high maximum feeding rate and high attack rate of T. s. scripta, combined with its numerical response proxies of lifespan and fecundity, gave it the highest impact potential. It was also the second most readily available according to our UK surveys, indicating a high invasion risk. Despite having the lowest maximum feeding rate and attack rate, S. odoratus has a high invasion risk due to high availability and we highlight this species as requiring monitoring. The RIP/RIR metrics offer two universally applicable methods to assess potential impacts and risks associated with emerging and future invaders in the pet trade and other sources of future IAS. These metrics highlight T. s. scripta as having high impact and invasion risk, corroborating its position on the EU list of 49 IAS of Union Concern. This suggests our methodology and metrics have great potential to direct future IAS policy decisions and management. This, however, relies on collation and generation of new data on alien species functional responses, numerical responses and their proxies, and imaginative measures of propagule pressure.",Ecological impacts | Functional response | Invasive alien species | Numerical response | Pet propagule pressure | Relative impact potential | Relative invasion risk | Risk assessment,7,1,CalEPA,EPA,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Animals exhibit diverse dispersal strategies, including sex-biased dispersal, a phenomenon common in vertebrates. Dispersal influences the genetic structure of populations as well as geographic variation in phenotypic traits. Patterns of spatial genetic structure and geographic variation may vary between the sexes whenever males and females exhibit different dispersal behaviors. Here, we examine dispersal, spatial genetic structure, and spatial acoustic structure in Rufous-and-white Wrens, a year-round resident tropical bird. Both sexes sing in this species, allowing us to compare acoustic variation between males and females and examine the relationship between dispersal and song sharing for both sexes. Using a long-term dataset collected over an 11-year period, we used banding data and molecular genetic analyses to quantify natal and breeding dispersal distance in Rufous-and-white Wrens. We quantified song sharing and examined whether sharing varied with dispersal distance, for both males and females. Observational data and molecular genetic analyses indicate that dispersal is female-biased. Females dispersed farther from natal territories than males, and more often between breeding territories than males. Furthermore, females showed no significant spatial genetic structure, consistent with expectations, whereas males showed significant spatial genetic structure. Overall, natal dispersal appears to have more influence than breeding dispersal on spatial genetic structure and spatial acoustic structure, given that the majority of breeding dispersal events resulted in individuals moving only short distances. Song sharing between pairs of same-sex animals decreases with the distance between their territories for both males and females, although males exhibited significantly greater song sharing than females. Lastly, we measured the relationship between natal dispersal distance and song sharing. We found that sons shared fewer songs with their fathers the farther they dispersed from their natal territories, but that song sharing between daughters and mothers was not significantly correlated with natal dispersal distance. Our results reveal cultural differences between the sexes, suggesting a relationship between culture and sex-biased dispersal.",natal dispersal | sex-biased dispersal | song learning | songbird | spatial genetic structure,5,1,,undefined,Government of Ontario

Low levels of heterozygosity can have detrimental effects on life history and growth characteristics of organisms but more subtle effects such as those on trade-offs of expensive tissues and morphological laterality, especially of the brain, have not been explicitly tested. The objective of the current study was to investigate how estimated differences in heterozygosity may potentially affect brain-to-body trade-offs and to explore how these heterozygosity differences may affect differential brain growth, focusing on directional asymmetry in adult Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) using the laterality and absolute laterality indices. Level of inbreeding was estimated as mean microsatellite heterozygosity resulting in four ‘inbreeding level groups’ (Very High, High, Medium, Low). A higher inbreeding level corresponded with a decreased brain-to-body ratio, thus a decrease in investment in brain tissue, and also showed a decrease in the laterality index for the cerebellum, where the left hemisphere was larger than the right across all groups. These results begin to show the role that differences in heterozygosity may play in differential tissue investment and in morphological laterality, and may be useful in two ways. Firstly, the results may be valuable for restocking programmes that wish to emphasize brain or body growth when crossing adults to generate individuals for release, as we show that genetic variation does affect these trade-offs. Secondly, this study is one of the first examinations to test the hypothesized relationship between genetic variation and laterality, finding that in Chinook salmon there is potential for an effect of inbreeding on lateralized morphology, but not in the expected direction.",Brain lateralization | Energy trade-off hypothesis | Heterozygosity | Inbreeding | Laterality | Somatic trade-off,0,1,,STPGP 447241-13,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

This study tested the effect of photophase duration on black soldier fly, Hermetia illucens (L.; Diptera: Stratiomyidae), development. Successful larval eclosion, development time and adult emergence were measured for individuals exposed to 0 h, 8 h, and 12 h of light, at approximately 27°C and 70% relative humidity. Accumulated degree hours (ADH) were calculated to correct for differences in temperature across treatments. Larvae successfully eclosed in all treatments, with larvae in 12 h light requiring 5.77% and 4.5% fewer ADH to eclose than larvae in 0 h and 8 h, respectively. Overall, larvae in 0 h required 39.34% and 37.78% more ADH to complete their development from egg to adult than larvae in 8 h and 12 h, respectively. The effect of photophase duration on juvenile development was largest in the post-feeding stage, and smallest in the pupal stage. Specifically, post-feeding larvae in 0 h required 80.02% and 90.08% more ADH to pupate than larvae in 8 h and 12 h, respectively, but pupae in 8 h required 9.63% and 7.52% fewer ADH to eclose than pupae in 0 h and 12 h, respectively. Lastly, larval mortality was significantly higher in 0 h, with 72% survivorship, and 96% and 97% in 8 h and 12 h, respectively. However, 17.8% of mortality in the absence of light is hypothesized to be a result of predation by Arachnidae and Blattidae. These data could prove valuable for optimizing industrial processes for mass-production of this species for use as alternative protein in feed for livestock, poultry, and aquaculture.",aquaculture | Hermetia illucens | insect-based protein production | photoperiodism | waste conversion,0,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Whole-brain responses to sound are easily measured through auditory evoked potentials (AEP), but it is unclear how differences in experimental parameters affect these responses. The effect of varying parameters is especially unclear in fish studies, the majority of which use simple sound types and then extrapolate to natural conditions. The current study investigated AEPs in goldfish (Carassius auratus) using sounds of different durations (5, 10, and 20 ms) and frequencies (200, 500, 600 and 700 Hz) to test stimulus effects on latency and thresholds. We quantified differences in latency and threshold in comparison to a 10-ms test tone, a duration often used in AEP fish studies. Both response latency and threshold were significantly affected by stimulus duration, with latency patterning suggesting that AEP fires coincident with a decrease in stimulus strength. Response latency was also significantly affected by presentation frequency. These results show that stimulus type has important effects on AEP measures of hearing and call for clearer standards across different measures of AEP. Duration effects also suggest that AEP measures represent summed responses of duration-detecting neural circuit, but more effort is needed to understand the neural drivers of this commonly used technique.",Auditory evoked potential | Fish hearing | Response latency | Stimulus duration | Threshold,2,0,NSERC,2015-04476,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Habitat homogenization, nutrient enrichment and loss of biodiversity are broadly recognized as the consequences of human activity in aquatic systems. Diatoms (Bacillariophyceae) are frequently used in aquatic environmental assessment and impact monitoring, but in unique habitats dominated by endemic taxa, traditional approaches may not be appropriate. We examined the impacts of long term anthropogenic impacts upon the littoral episammic diatom community around the town of Soroako, located on Lake Matano, an ancient tropical lake. Lake Matano is located on central Sulawesi Island, Indonesia, and socio-economic conditions are typical of developing nations. Although differences in nutrient concentrations were undetectable with field-based spectroscopy approaches, mean Shannon diversity was decreased in association with proximity the town-site. However, mean ß-diversity was maintained despite several decades of shoreline modification at Soroako. Elevated abundances of early-successional diatom taxa in the disturbed area drove differences between areas immediately offshore of Soroako and those farther away. These findings suggest that increased physical disturbance and TSS loads around Soroako, rather than increased nutrient loading, influenced shifts in the diatom community. These results suggest that microscopy-based biomonitoring approaches are sensitive indicators of environmental modification that could be useful in areas where access to cutting-edge analytical equipment is limited.",Ancient lake | Diatoms | Disturbance | Environmental assessment | Lake Matano,2,0,Vale,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Asymmetrical intraguild predation (AIGP), which combines both predation and competition between predator species, is pervasive in nature with relative strengths varying by prey availability. But with species redistributions associated with climate change, the response by endemic predators within an AIGP context to changing biotic–abiotic conditions over time (i.e. seasonal and decadal) has yet to be quantified. Furthermore, little is known on AIGP dynamics in ecosystems undergoing rapid directional change such as the Arctic. Here, we investigate the flexibility of AIGP among two predators in the same trophic guild: beluga (Delphinapterus leucas) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), by season and over 30 years in Cumberland Sound - a system where forage fish capelin (Mallotus villosus) have recently become more available. Using stable isotopes, we illustrate different predator responses to temporal shifts in forage fish availability. On a seasonal cycle, beluga consumed less Greenland halibut and increased consumption of forage fish during summer, contrasting a constant consumption rate of forage fish by Greenland halibut year-round leading to decreased AIGP pressure between predators. Over a decadal scale (1982–2012), annual consumption of forage fish by beluga increased with a concomitant decline in the consumption of Greenland halibut, thereby indicating decreased AIGP pressure between predators in concordance with increased forage fish availability. The long-term changes of AIGP pressure between endemic predators illustrated here highlights climate-driven environmental alterations to interspecific intraguild interactions in the Arctic.",Climate change | Interspecific interactions | Predator–prey dynamics | Stable isotopes,5,1,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Globally intensive agriculture has both increased nitrogen pollution in adjacent waterways and decreased availability of terrestrially derived carbon frequently used by stream heterotrophs in nitrogen cycling. We tested the potential for carbon additions via leaf litter from riparian restoration plantings to act as a tool for enhancing denitrification in agricultural streams with relatively high concentrations of nitrate (1.3–8.1 mg/L) in Canterbury, New Zealand. Experimental additions of leaf packs (N = 200, mass = 350 g each) were carried out in 200-m reaches of three randomly selected treatment streams and compared to three control streams receiving no additional leaf carbon. Litter additions increased ecosystem respiration in treatment streams compared to control streams but did not affect gross primary production, indicating the carbon addition boosted heterotrophic activity, a useful gauge of the activities of microbes involved in denitrification. Bench-top assays with denitrifying enzymes using acetylene inhibition techniques also suggested that the coarse particulate organic matter added from leaf packs would have provided substrates suitable for high rates of denitrification. Quantifying denitrification directly in experimental reaches by open-channel methods based on membrane inlet mass spectrophotometry indicated that denitrification was around three times higher in treatment streams where litter was added compared to control streams. We further assessed the potential for riparian plantings to reduce large-scale downstream nitrogen losses through increasing in-stream denitrification by modeling the effects of increasing riparian vegetation cover on nitrogen fluxes. Here, we combined estimates of in-stream ecosystem processes derived from our experiment with a network model of catchment-scale nitrogen retention and removal based on empirical measurements of nitrogen flux in this typical agricultural catchment. Our model indicated leaf inputs associated with increased riparian cover had the potential to double the catchment level rate of denitrification, offering a promising way to mitigate nitrate pollution in agricultural streams. Altogether, our study indicates that overcoming carbon limitation and boosting heterotrophic processes will be important for reducing nitrogen pollution in agricultural streams and that combining empirical approaches for predictions suggests there are large potential benefits from riparian re-vegetation efforts at catchment scales.",Carbon limitation | Denitrification | Ecosystem respiration | Heterotrophic processes | Leaf litter | Metabolism | Nitrogen pollution | Production | Restoration | Streams | Watershed model,8,1,UC,undefined,University of Canterbury

Considerable attention has been focused on the concept of Propagule Pressure (number of individuals introduced and introduction events) as a predictor of invasion success (975 papers). Much less well studied is the role of Colonization Pressure (number of species introduced; 24 studies), the complement of propagule pressure. Here we review the invasion history of the Laurentian Great Lakes to predict the risk of a future invasive (i.e. producing adverse ecological effects on other species) non-indigenous species based upon the number of species introduced (colonization pressure), using the recorded history of invasions in this system as our starting point. Historically, 52% of the fishes that were introduced and became established in the Great Lakes were subsequently identified in the literature as invasive, whereas the value for invertebrates (16%) was much lower. Assuming future invaders have similar invasion attributes as those already present, the risk of getting at least one high impact species is positively and asymptotically related to the number of species introduced, though the rate is substantially higher for fishes than for invertebrates. Our study provides support for the contention that managers ought to focus initially on vectors transmitting multiple species when attempting to prevent invasion of their system by species likely to become problematic.",Great Lakes | invasion success | invasive species | propagule pressure,0,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Species richness and species abundance (colonization pressure and propagule pressure, respectively) are commonly used to characterize invasion risk for ballast-water-mediated introductions, which can be high if either parameter is high. For practical reasons, the adopted IMO-D2 standard for organisms in discharged ballast water only considers total abundance of biological indicators, without consideration of species richness or source community. Here we explore the effect of ballast-water source, ballast water exchange, chlorination, or a combination of both (hybrid treatment) on both colonization pressure and propagule pressure for one IMO-D2 size class (≥10 µm and <50 µm; phytoplankton). A strong reduction of propagule pressure was observed in all experimental trials and taxonomic groups, probably owing to environment conditions inside ballast tanks and treatment effects. However, only the hybrid treatment met the IMO-D2 standard for propagule pressure, while also significantly reducing colonization pressure, from 25 initial groups to 16 final groups. In this treatment, dinoflagellates and diatoms dominated final composition. The impact of different treatments on colonization pressure and propagule pressure was always lower when the vessel was ballasted in a brackish than freshwater port. Our study demonstrates that even treated ballast water compliant with the IMO-D2 standard may still harbor a diverse phytoplankton community, albeit with low individual species abundances. These results might be similar even using a type approved ballast water management systems which usually includes a filter for >50 µm organisms as a pre-treatment.",IMO-D2 standard | invasion risk | invasive species | phytoplankton | vectors of introduction,2,0,,undefined,Canada Research Chairs

Herein, we use genetic data from 277 sleeper sharks to perform coalescent-based modeling to test the hypothesis of early Quaternary emergence of the Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus) from ancestral sleeper sharks in the Canadian Arctic-Subarctic region. Our results show that morphologically cryptic somniosids S. microcephalus and Somniosus pacificus can be genetically distinguished using combined mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers. Our data confirm the presence of genetically admixed individuals in the Canadian Arctic and sub-Arctic, and temperate Eastern Atlantic regions, suggesting introgressive hybridization upon secondary contact following the initial species divergence. Conservative substitution rates fitted to an Isolation with Migration (IM) model indicate a likely species divergence time of 2.34 Ma, using the mitochondrial sequence DNA, which in conjunction with the geographic distribution of admixtures and Pacific signatures likely indicates speciation associated with processes other than the closing of the Isthmus of Panama. This time span coincides with further planetary cooling in the early Quaternary period followed by the onset of oscillating glacial-interglacial cycles. We propose that the initial S. microcephalus–S. pacificus split, and subsequent hybridization events, were likely associated with the onset of Pleistocene glacial oscillations, whereby fluctuating sea levels constrained connectivity among Arctic oceanic basins, Arctic marginal seas, and the North Atlantic Ocean. Our data demonstrates support for the evolutionary consequences of oscillatory vicariance via transient oceanic isolation with subsequent secondary contact associated with fluctuating sea levels throughout the Quaternary period—which may serve as a model for the origins of Arctic marine fauna on a broad taxonomic scale.",elasmobranch | Greenland shark | interspecific gene flow | introgressive hybridization | isolation with migration | Somniosus microcephalus,2,1,,184644/S40,Adam Taliaferro Foundation

Background: Pitx3 plays a well understood role in directing development of lens, muscle fiber, and dopaminergic neurons; however, in Xenopus laevis, it may also play a role in early gastrulation and somitogenesis. Potential downstream targets of pitx3 possess multiple binding motifs that would not be readily accessible by conventional promoter analysis. Results: We isolated and characterized pitx3 target genes lhx1 and xnr5 using a novel three-fluor flow cytometry tool that was designed to dissect promoters with multiple binding sites for the same transcription factor. This approach was calibrated using a known pitx3 target gene, Tyrosine hydroxylase. Conclusions: We demonstrate how flow cytometry can be used to detect gene regulatory changes with exquisite precision on a cell-by-cell basis, and establish that in HEK293 cells, pitx3 directly activates lhx1 and represses xnr5.

Female blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) demonstrate site preferences when ovipositing on carrion. Preference for oviposition sites is believed to reflect the suitability of the site such that the most preferred locations provide offspring with the greatest chance of survival. A number of factors might influence female choice, including area available for oviposition. For species known to aggregate during oviposition, the surface area of oviposition sites may be a key factor in the decision-making process. Using ImageJ, the surface area or volume of eight common oviposition sites on 13 fetal pig (Sus scrofa domesticus L.) carcasses was measured. Regression analysis was used to determine if body mass could predict the area or volume available for oviposition. We observed significant positive relationships between size of oviposition sites and body mass for all eight oviposition sites. The strongest relationships were observed for the face (R2=0.86) and legs (R2=0.84). To test the predictive capacity of this relationship, a blind validation study was performed. Five pigs of various body masses were randomly selected, and the available space of the eight sites was estimated using the regression equations. The validation study confirmed that the regression equations for most oviposition sites demonstrated their predictive capacity based on 95% prediction intervals. This research provides a tool that can be used to correct for differences in oviposition site area or volume between carcasses of varying mass so that researchers may gain a greater understanding of the oviposition preferences and aggregation behaviors in future studies.",Female preference | Forensic entomology | ImageJ,1,0,,undefined,Ontario Innovation Trust

Scientific conferences are more impactful when they foster novel ideas, create new networks, and promote inter-disciplinary collaboration. The field of conservation physiology is inherently cross-disciplinary, representing the application of physiological techniques and knowledge to address conservation issues. Ideally, knowledge transfer comes from both directions: conservation biologists seek input on physiological techniques that can contribute to the success of their programs, and physiologists collaborate with conservation biologists to plan relevant applications for their work. To assess whether the level of integration between conservation and physiology has been increasing since the formal naming of the discipline of conservation physiology in 2006, we reviewed abstracts from conferences of three societies: Society for Conservation Biology (SCB), Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology (SICB), and Society for Experimental Biology (SEB). Specifically, we searched for physiology-related keywords in abstracts from SCB meetings, and for conservation-related keywords in abstracts from SICB and SEB. Our results indicate that the percentage of presentations incorporating physiology at conservation meetings has remained relatively steady (2–3%). In contrast, the percentage of presentations citing conservation applications has been rising at both of the integrative biology societies’ meetings and has reached 4.4 and 7.9% at SICB and SEB, respectively. We provide suggestions for why there may be discrepancies between conference types and ways to encourage the presence of physiological topics at future conservation meetings.",Conservation biology | Conservation physiology | Cross-disciplinary | Integration | Inter-disciplinary | Meeting,2,0,,undefined,Canada Research Chairs

The two-note fee bee song of the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) is sung at many different absolute frequencies, but the relative frequencies, or “pitch ratios”, between the start and end of the fee note (glissando) and the fee and the bee notes (inter-note interval) are preserved with each pitch-shift. Ability to perceive these ratios and their relative salience varies with sex of the bird and setting: while both sexes appear to perceive changes in the inter-note interval, males appear to attend to the glissando in the field, and females appear to attend to both ratios. In this study, we compared directly whether male and female chickadees could discriminate between normal fee bee songs and songs that had one or both of the pitch ratios altered, and whether birds attended to one type of alteration over another. Both sexes learned to discriminate normal from altered songs; songs lacking an inter-note interval were more easily discriminated than songs with only the glissando removed. Females performed slightly better than males, including in the most difficult task with the stimuli lacking the glissando.

Despite a well-developed theoretical basis for the role of genetic diversity in the colonization process, contemporary investigations of genetic diversity in biological invasions have downplayed its importance. Observed reductions in genetic diversity have been argued to have a limited effect on the success of establishment and impact based on empirical studies; however, those studies rarely include assessment of failed or comparatively less-successful biological invasions. We address this gap by comparing genetic diversity at microsatellite loci for taxonomically and geographically paired aquatic invasive species. Our four species pairs contain one highly successful and one less-successful invasive species (Gobies: Neogobius melanostomus, Proterorhinus semilunaris; waterfleas: Bythotrephes longimanus, Cercopagis pengoi; oysters: Crassostrea gigas, Crassostrea virginica; tunicates: Bortylloides violaceous, Botryllus schlosseri). We genotyped 2717 individuals across all species from multiple locations in multiple years and explicitly test whether genetic diversity is lower for less-successful biological invaders within each species pair. We demonstrate that, for gobies and tunicates, reduced allelic diversity is associated with lower success of invasion. We also found that less-successful invasive species tend to have greater divergence among populations. This suggests that intraspecific hybridization may be acting to convert among-population variation to within-population variation for highly successful invasive species and buffering any loss of diversity. While our findings highlight the species-specific nature of the effects of genetic diversity on invasion success, they do support the use of genetic diversity information in the management of current species invasions and in the risk assessment of potential future invaders.",Alpha diversity | Beta diversity | Neutral genetic variation | Non-indigenous,5,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

However, directly assessing these performances in candidate mates could be difficult. Instead, the use of indirect cues related to problem-solving and/or learning performance, such as condition-dependent phenotypic traits, might be favored. We investigated whether problem-solving and learning performance on a novel non-foraging task correlated with sexually selected plumage colouration in a natural population of great tits Parus major. We found that males successful in solving the task had darker blue-black crowns than non-solvers, and that males solving the task more rapidly over multiple attempts (i.e. learners) exhibited blue-black crowns with higher UV chroma and shorter-wavelength hues than non-learners. In contrast, we found no link between behavioural performance on the task and the yellow breast colouration in either sex. Our findings suggest that blue-black crown colouration could serve as a signal of problem-solving and learning performance in wild great tit males. Further research remains necessary to determine whether different sexually selected traits are used to signal cognitive performance for mate choice, either directly (i.e. cognitive performance influencing individual's health and ornamentation through diet for example) or indirectly (i.e. due to a correlation with a third factor such as individual quality or condition).",,1,0,,31520,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Maternal stress can prenatally influence offspring phenotypes and there are an increasing number of ecological studies that are bringing to bear biomedical findings to natural systems. This is resulting in a shift from the perspective that maternal stress is unanimously costly, to one in which maternal stress may be beneficial to offspring. However, this adaptive perspective is in its infancy with much progress to still be made in understanding the role of maternal stress in natural systems. Our aim is to emphasize the importance of the ecological and evolutionary context within which adaptive hypotheses of maternal stress can be evaluated. We present five primary research areas where we think future research can make substantial progress: (1) understanding maternal and offspring control mechanisms that modulate exposure between maternal stress and subsequent offspring phenotype response; (2) understanding the dynamic nature of the interaction between mothers and their environment; (3) integrating offspring phenotypic responses and measuring both maternal and offspring fitness outcomes under real-life (either free-living or semi-natural) conditions; (4) empirically testing these fitness outcomes across relevant spatial and temporal environmental contexts (both pre- and postnatal environments); (5) examining the role of maternal stress effects in human-altered environments-i.e., do they limit or enhance fitness.

Lipids affect stable isotope values generated for marine fishes, however these effects remain poorly described for many extant shark taxa, especially deep-sea species. Here, we report the effects of lipid extraction (LE) on δ13C, δ15N, and C:N values of seven deep-sea sharks, generate novel mathematical normalizations for δ13C based on the relationship between bulk and lipid extracted values (δ13CBulk and δ13CLE) and examine whether common normalized correction models provide a robust method for addressing lipid-biasing effects in two species, the Cuban dogfish (Squalus cubensis; n = 20), and Greenland shark (Somniosus microcephalus; n = 24). LE generally resulted in enrichment of 13C and 15N, but produced variable effects on C:N across all species. Novel mathematical normalizations for δ13C were derived from the pooled shark community, and a single species-specific correction was generated for the Cuban dogfish, but could not be determined for the Greenland shark. Four common lipid correction models used for teleosts, failed to accurately predict δ13C values statistically similar to δ13CLE, in both Cuban dogfish and Greenland sharks, likely due to the confounding effects of lipids and urea on C:N. These observations suggest that chemical lipid extraction should be a mandatory procedure prior to interpreting stable isotope data for deep-sea sharks, at least for those species where lipid effects are large.",Chondrichthyan | Deep-sea | Elasmobranch | Stable isotope analysis | The Bahamas | The Canadian Arctic,3,0,,undefined,University of Exeter

Urbanization strongly influences headwater stream chemistry and hydrology, but little is known about how these conditions impact bacterial community composition. We predicted that urbanization would impact bacterial community composition, but that stream water column bacterial communities would be most strongly linked to urbanization at a watershed-scale, as measured by impervious cover, while sediment bacterial communities would correlate with environmental conditions at the scale of stream reaches. To test this hypothesis, we determined bacterial community composition in the water column and sediment of headwater streams located across a gradient of watershed impervious cover using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Alpha diversity metrics did not show a strong response to catchment urbanization, but beta diversity was significantly related to watershed impervious cover with significant differences also found between water column and sediment samples. Samples grouped primarily according to habitat-water column vs. sediment-with a significant response to watershed impervious cover nested within each habitat type. Compositional shifts for communities in urbanized streams indicated an increase in taxa associated with human activity including bacteria from the genus Polynucleobacter, which is widespread, but has been associated with eutrophic conditions in larger water bodies. Another indicator of communities in urbanized streams was an OTU from the genus Gallionella, which is linked to corrosion of water distribution systems. To identify changes in bacterial community interactions, bacterial co-occurrence networks were generated from urban and forested samples. The urbanized co-occurrence network was much smaller and had fewer co-occurrence events per taxon than forested equivalents, indicating a loss of keystone taxa with urbanization. Our results suggest that urbanization has significant impacts on the community composition of headwater streams, and suggest that processes driving these changes in urbanized water column vs. sediment environments are distinct.",16S rRNA gene | Bacteria | Community ecology | Streams | Urbanization | Watersheds,16,1,,DEB-1210516,National Science Foundation

However, the genetic architecture of gene expression has received much less attention than that of traditional phenotypic traits. In this study, we used a 5 × 5 full-factorial breeding design within each of two Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) populations to characterize the genetic architecture of gene transcription. The two populations (LaHave and Sebago) are being used for reintroduction efforts into Lake Ontario, Canada. We used high-throughput quantitative real-time PCR to measure gene transcription levels for 22 genes in muscle tissue of Atlantic salmon fry. We tested for population differences in gene transcription and partitioned the transcription variance into additive genetic, non-additive genetic and maternal effects within each population. Interestingly, average additive genetic effects for gene transcription were smaller than those reported for traditional phenotypic traits in salmonids, suggesting that the evolutionary potential of gene transcription is lower than that of traditional traits. Contrary to expectations for early life stage traits, maternal effects were small. In general, the LaHave population had higher additive genetic effects for gene transcription than the Sebago population had, indicating that the LaHave fish have a higher adaptive potential to respond to the novel selection pressures associated with reintroduction into a novel environment. This study highlights not only the profound variation in gene transcription possible among salmonid populations but also the among-population variation in the underlying genetic architecture of such traits.",,0,1,,undefined,

Such approaches, however, are known to be unreliable since they yield different biomarker sets when applied to data sets from different studies. Gathering knowledge about the functional relationship among genes will identify ""network biomarkers"" that will enrich the criteria for biomarker selection. Cancer network biomarkers are subnetworks of functionally related genes that ""work in concert"" to perform functions associated with a tumorigenic.

Cdk enzymatic activity is tightly controlled through cyclin interactions, posttranslational modifications, and binding of inhibitors such as the p27 tumor suppressor protein. Spy1/RINGO (Spy1) proteins bind and activate Cdk but are resistant to canonical regulatory mechanisms that establish cell-cycle checkpoints. Cancer cells exploit Spy1 to stimulate proliferation through inappropriate activation of Cdks, yet the mechanism is unknown. We have determined crystal structures of the Cdk2-Spy1 and p27-Cdk2-Spy1 complexes that reveal how Spy1 activates Cdk. We find that Spy1 confers structural changes to Cdk2 that obviate the requirement of Cdk activation loop phosphorylation. Spy1 lacks the cyclin-binding site that mediates p27 and substrate affinity, explaining why Cdk-Spy1 is poorly inhibited by p27 and lacks specificity for substrates with cyclin-docking sites. We identify mutations in Spy1 that ablate its ability to activate Cdk2 and to proliferate cells.

Open-pit mining of the Athabasca oil sands has generated large volumes of waste termed fluid fine tailings (FFT), stored in tailings ponds. Accumulation of toxic organic substances in the tailings ponds is one of the biggest concerns. Gamma irradiation (GI) treatment could accelerate the biodegradation of toxic organic substances. Hence, this research investigates the response of the microbial consortia in GI-treated FFT materials with an emphasis on changes in diversity and organism-related stimuli. FFT materials from aged and fresh ponds were used in the study under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. Variations in the microbial diversity in GI-treated FFT materials were monitored for 52 weeks and significant stimuli (p < 0.05) were observed. Chemoorganotrophic organisms dominated in fresh and aged ponds and showed increased relative abundance resulting from GI treatment. GI-treated anaerobic FFTaged reported stimulus of organisms with biodegradation potential (e.g., Pseudomonas, Enterobacter) and methylotrophic capabilities (e.g., Syntrophus, Smithella). In comparison, GI-treated anaerobic FFTfresh stimulated Desulfuromonas as the principle genus at 52 weeks. Under aerobic conditions, GI-treated FFTaged showed stimulation of organisms capable of sulfur and iron cycling (e.g., Geobacter). However, GI-treated aerobic FFTfresh showed no stimulus at 52 weeks. This research provides an enhanced understanding of oil sands tailings biogeochemistry and the impacts of GI treatment on microorganisms as an effect for targeting toxic organics. The outcomes of this study highlight the potential for this approach to accelerate stabilization and reclamation end points.

Predictions of the identities and ecological impacts of invasive alien species are critical for risk assessment, but presently we lack universal and standardized metrics that reliably predict the likelihood and degree of impact of such invaders (i.e. measurable changes in populations of affected species). This need is especially pressing for emerging and potential future invaders that have no invasion history. Such a metric would also ideally apply across diverse taxonomic and trophic groups. We derive a new metric of invader ecological impact that blends: (i) the classic Functional Response (FR; consumer per capita effect) and Numerical Response (NR; consumer population response) approaches to determining consumer impact, that is, the Total Response (TR = FR × NR), with; (ii) the ‘Parker–Lonsdale equation’ for invader impact, where Impact = Range × Abundance × Effect (per capita effect), into; (iii) a new metric, Relative Impact Potential (RIP), where RIP = FR × Abundance. The RIP metric is an invader/native ratio, where values >1 predict that invader ecological impact will occur, and increasing values above 1 indicate increasing impact. In addition, the invader/invader RIP ratio allows comparisons of the ecological impacts of different invaders. Across a diverse range of trophic and taxonomic groups, including predators, herbivores, animals and plants (22 invader/native systems with 47 individual comparisons), high-impact invaders were significantly associated with higher FRs compared to native trophic analogues. However, the RIP metric substantially improves this association, with 100% predictive power of high-impact invaders. Further, RIP scores were significantly and positively correlated with two independent ecological impact scores for invaders, allowing prediction of the degree of impact of invasive alien species with the RIP metric. Finally, invader/invader RIP scores were also successful in identifying and associating with higher impacting invasive alien species. Synthesis and applications. The Relative Impact Potential metric combines the per capita effects of invaders with their abundances, relative to trophically analogous natives, and is successful in predicting the likelihood and degree of ecological impact caused by invasive alien species.

All rights reserved. The contraction of aquatic, and expansion of terrestrial, habitats in association with flow cessation and drying in intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES) fundamentally affect interactions among IRES organisms. Drying alters the relative contributions of autotrophy and heterotrophy to food webs because shredders, microbes, and autotrophs are affected, which often leads heterotrophy to become dominant. Changes in ecosystem dimensions, conditions, and resources fundamentally alter the types, sizes, and abundance of organisms present. Spatial and temporal fragmentation of habitats constrains, compresses, and sometimes expands trophic interactions, often substantially altering interaction strengths due to disproportional effects on large top predators. Drying and rewetting alter the trophic linking of aquatic and terrestrial habitats laterally, longitudinally, and vertically, with the form of food web modification in IRES related to regional differences in climate, biota, and riparian structure. Overall, drying reduces aquatic food chain length and trophic diversity, and often culminates in collapse of aquatic food webs; however, it can also trigger transitions toward terrestrial energy pathways and likely expands terrestrial food web dimensions. Given that hysteresis effects and strong, destabilizing interactions have been observed in drying stream food webs, global changes that exacerbate or produce unnatural drying are likely to have deleterious influences in IRES.",Aquatic ecology | Community stability | Conservation | Ephemeral streams | Food webs | Intermittent rivers | Predation | Trophic interactions,6,0,,undefined,

All rights reserved.. Microbial diversity and function in intermittent rivers and ephemeral streams (IRES) are tightly linked to specific habitat availability and hydrological phases. The intensity and frequency of the different phases (especially drying and rewetting) affect community composition and key functions, mainly linked to biogeochemical processes. Resistance and resilience strategies are distinct among microorganism groups-bacteria, archaea, fungi, protozoans-and strongly depend on different types of microhabitat or refuge available. The biodiversity of prokaryotes in IRES is strongly affected by hydrology but microhabitat conditions and type of benthic substrate significantly affect their community composition. Fungi are very sensitive to drying but use several refuges, including the terrestrial habitat, and resistance strategies. Protozoans show a wide range of survival strategies and several species can resist harsh conditions such as anoxia in drying pools. Thus, they become especially relevant for ecosystem functions when other organisms are inhibited. This sensitivity causes ""waves"" of microbial functions and biodiversity to covary with hydrological phases, potentially affecting ecosystem functioning and higher trophic levels. Microbially mediated functions in IRES are perhaps the most critical to freshwater ecosystem services such as nitrogen and carbon cycling. Therefore, efforts to manage and restore IRES will depend on improved understanding of hydrological controls on microbial communities and functions across space and time. © 2017 Copyright",Archaea | Bacteria | Drought | Fungi | Microbial communities | Microbial function | Protozoa | Resilience | Resistance | Rewetting,9,0,,undefined,

The taxonomy of the genus Melozone has recently been analyzed from genus to subspecies level, leading to a significant revision of our understanding of this group of birds. Previous studies quantified differences in phenotypic traits, behavior, and genotypes, to provide a better understanding of the underappreciated diversity within Melozone and the relationship between species within this genus. Yet the relationship between the subspecies of White-eared Ground-sparrows, Melo-zone leucotis, has not received thorough taxonomic scrutiny. In this study, we evaluate the taxonomic status of the three recognized subspecies of M. leucotis using multiple morphometric characteristics, plumage color features, and vocaliza-tions. We measured plumage patterns and reflectance from museum specimens, morphometric features from museum specimens and live birds, and vocal characteristics from sound recordings. We observed substantial variation between sub-species in plumage, morphometry, and voice, especially between northern and southern birds. The phenotypic and vocal differences exhibited by M. l. occipitalis (from Chiapas, Mexico; Guatemala; and El Salvador) suggest that its taxonomic relationship with the M. l. leucotis and M. l. nigrior complex (from Costa Rica and Nicaragua, respectively) needs to be reevaluated, because these two groups are highly diagnosable from one another. Additionally, M. l. occipitalis is geograph-ically isolated from the other two subspecies, reducing the probability of contact by natural causes in the near future. Based on the clear differences in voice, plumage, and morphometric features reported here, we propose that M. l. occipitalis be recognized as a distinct species, M. occipitalis (Salvin's Ground-sparrow), diagnosed on the basis of its longer tail, longer bill, duller plumage, and songs with a lower frequency of maximum amplitude.",Central America | Spectrophotometry | Subspecies | Taxonomic status | Vocalizations,1,0,,undefined,

Evolutionary Applications published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd Phenotypic plasticity buffers organisms from environmental change and is hypothesized to aid the initial establishment of nonindigenous species in novel environments and postestablishment range expansion. The genetic mechanisms that underpin phenotypically plastic traits are generally poorly characterized; however, there is strong evidence that modulation of gene transcription is an important component of these responses. Here, we use RNA sequencing to examine the transcriptional basis of temperature tolerance for round and tubenose goby, two nonindigenous fish species that differ dramatically in the extent of their Great Lakes invasions despite similar invasion dates. We used generalized linear models of read count data to compare gene transcription responses of organisms exposed to increased and decreased water temperature from those at ambient conditions. We identify greater response in the magnitude of transcriptional changes for the more successful round goby compared with the less successful tubenose goby. Round goby transcriptional responses reflect alteration of biological function consistent with adaptive responses to maintain or regain homeostatic function in other species. In contrast, tubenose goby transcription patterns indicate a response to stressful conditions, but the pattern of change in biological functions does not match those expected for a return to homeostatic status. Transcriptional plasticity plays an important role in the acute thermal tolerance for these species; however, the impaired response to stress we demonstrate in the tubenose goby may contribute to their limited invasion success relative to the round goby. Transcriptional profiling allows the simultaneous assessment of the magnitude of transcriptional response as well as the biological functions involved in the response to environmental stress and is thus a valuable approach for evaluating invasion potential.",biological invasions | gene expression | nonindigenous species | phenotypic plasticity | round goby | tubenose goby,12,1,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

It is characterized by extensive loss of epithelial tissue integrity, which initiates a regenerative response by intestinal stem and precursor cells. The intestine has 24-hour rhythms in many physiological functions that are believed to be outputs of the circadian clock: a molecular system that produces 24-hour rhythms in transcription/translation. Certain gastrointestinal illnesses are worsened when the circadian rhythms are disrupted, but the role of the circadian clock in gastrointestinal regeneration has not been studied. Methods We tested the timing of regeneration in the mouse intestine during the gastrointestinal syndrome. The role of the circadian clock was tested genetically using the BMAL1 loss of function mouse mutant in vivo, and in vitro using intestinal organoid culture. Results The proliferation of the intestinal epithelium follows a 24-hour rhythm during the gastrointestinal syndrome. The circadian clock runs in the intestinal epithelium during this pathologic state, and the loss of the core clock gene, BMAL1, disrupts both the circadian clock and rhythmic proliferation. Circadian activity in the intestine involves a rhythmic production of inflammatory cytokines and subsequent rhythmic activation of the JNK stress response pathway. Conclusions Our results show that a circadian rhythm in inflammation and regeneration occurs during the gastrointestinal syndrome. The study and treatment of radiation-induced illnesses, and other gastrointestinal illnesses, should consider 24-hour timing in physiology and pathology.",Circadian Rhythms | Gastrointestinal Syndrome | Intestinal Stem Cells | Intestine | TNF,15,1,,R01DK084056,Human Frontier Science Program

Upon hearing a conspecific signal, animals must assess their relationship with the signaller and respond appropriately. Territorial animals usually respond more aggressively to strangers than neighbors in a phenomenon known as the “dear enemy effect”. This phenomenon likely evolved because strangers represent a threat to an animal's territory tenure and parentage, whereas neighbors only represent a threat to an animal's parentage because they already possess a territory (providing territory boundaries are established and stable). Although the dear enemy effect has been widely documented using behavioral response variables, little research has been conducted on the physiological responses of animals to neighbors versus strangers. We sought to investigate whether the dear enemy effect is observed physiologically by exposing territorial male song sparrows (Melospiza melodia) to playback simulating a neighbor or a stranger, and then collecting blood samples to measure plasma testosterone levels. We predicted that song sparrows would exhibit increased testosterone levels after exposure to stranger playback compared to neighbor playback, due to the role testosterone plays in regulating aggression. Contrary to our prediction, we found that song sparrows had higher testosterone levels after exposure to neighbor playback compared to stranger playback. We discuss several explanations for our result, notably that corticosterone may regulate the dear enemy effect in male song sparrows and this may inhibit plasma testosterone. Future studies will benefit from examining corticosterone in addition to testosterone, to better understand the hormonal underpinnings of the dear enemy effect.",Dear enemy effect | Melospiza melodia | Neighbor-stranger discrimination | Song sparrow | Testosterone,1,0,,undefined,Queen's University

While much is known about the relationship between Clark's nutcracker and whitebark pine, information on nutcracker energetic behavioural strategies − the driving factors behind nutcracker emigration − and the impact of nutcracker behaviour on whitebark pine communities remain uncertain. To investigate nutcracker energetic behaviour, we developed a spatially explicit agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the underlying behavioural mechanisms nutcrackers are most likely to employ during foraging in the South Cascades near Mt. Rainier, Washington. The ABM is comprised of cognitive nutcracker agents possessing memory and decision-making heuristics that act to optimize energy acquisition and loss. Environmental data layers for elevation and basal area of tree species were used to represent the landscape in terms of habitat and energy resources. We employed the evaludation approach for an organized sequence of model development and analysis, including: data evaluation, conceptual model evaluation, implementation, verification, model output verification (calibration consisting of comparison of parameters informed by nutcracker ecology to real-world empirical values; pattern-oriented modeling − POM), model analysis (sensitivity of model to changes in parameters and processes), and model output corroboration (use of POM to compare model output to real-world patterns from empirical investigations of nutcracker ecology, independent of calibration). Simulations were conducted on alternative nutcracker behavioural-energetic mechanism strategies by assigning different fitness-maximizing goals to agents. We found that an integrated energetic requirement (IER) mechanism, which includes both the short-term and long-term energetic needs of nutcracker agents to be the best-fit scenario. Our results affirm previous research that nutcrackers are responsive to changes in their energetic environment, and that they are capable of projecting energy budgets well into the future. The development of this ABM provides a basis for future research, such as a means to assess the driving conditions necessary for nutcrackers when choosing between a resident and emigrant strategy and as a planning tool to model nutcracker responses to potential landscape changes, which may facilitate long-term WBP conservation.",Agent-based modeling | Clark's nutcracker behaviour | Conservation | Ecosystem dynamics | Spatial ecology | Whitebark pine,2,0,,undefined,

Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd. Alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) are prevalent in nature, where smaller parasitic males typically have better sperm quality than larger territorial guard males. At present, it is unclear what is causing this phenomenon. Our objective was to gain insights into sperm form and function by examining flagellar beating patterns (beat frequency, wave amplitude, bend length, bend angle, wave velocity) and biomechanical sperm metrics (velocity, hydrodynamic power output, propulsive efficiency) of wild spawning Chinook salmon ARTs. Ovarian fluid and milt were collected to form a series of eight experimental blocks, each composed of ovarian fluid from a unique female and sperm from a unique pair of parasitic jack and guard hooknose males. Sperm from each ART were activated in river water and ovarian fluid. Flagellar parameters were evaluated from recordings using high-speed video microscopy and biomechanical metrics were quantified.We show that ART has an impact on flagellar beating, where jacks had a higher bend length and bend angle than hooknoses. Activation media also impacted the pattern of flagellar parameters, such that beat frequency, wave velocity and bend angle declined, while wave amplitude of flagella increased when ovarian fluid was incorporated into activation media. Furthermore, we found that sperm from jacks swam faster than those from hooknoses and required less hydrodynamic power output to propel themselves in river water and ovarian fluid. Jack sperm were also more efficient at swimming than hooknose sperm, and propulsive efficiency increased when cells were activated in ovarian fluid. The results demonstrate that sperm biomechanics may be driving divergence in competitive reproductive success between ARTs.",Cryptic female choice | Oncorhynchus tshawytscha | Reproductive strategy | Salmon | Spawning | Sperm competition,10,1,,undefined,

In fishes, ovarian fluid (OF) released with the eggs can increase male sperm velocity and potentially facilitate cryptic female choice for males of specific phenotypes and/or genotypes. Therefore, to investigate the effect of OF on fertilization success, we measured sperm velocity and conducted in vitro competitive fertilizations with paired Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) males representing two alternative reproductive tactics, jacks (small sneaker males) and hooknoses (large guarding males), in the presence of river water alone and OF mixed with river water. To determine the effect of genetic differences on fertilization success, we genotyped fish at neutral (microsatellites) and functional [major histocompatibility complex (MHC) II ß1] markers. We found that when sperm were competed in river water, jacks sired significantly more offspring than hooknoses; however, in OF, there was no difference in paternity between the tactics. Sperm velocity was significantly correlated with paternity success in river water, but not in ovarian fluid. Paternity success in OF, but not in river water alone, was correlated with genetic relatedness between male and female, where males that were less related to the female attained greater paternity. We found no relationship between MHC II ß1 divergence between mates and paternity success in water or OF.

Despite extensive efforts and continual progress in research and medicine, outcomes for patients with high-grade glioma remain exceptionally poor. Over the past decade, research has revealed a great deal about the complex biology behind glioma development, and has brought to light some of the major barriers preventing successful treatment. Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (stage 4 astrocytoma) is a highly dynamic tumour and one of the most extreme examples of intratumoural heterogeneity, making targeting with specific therapeutics an inefficient and highly unpredictable goal. The cancer stem cell hypothesis offers a new view on the possible mechanisms dictating the heterogeneous nature of this disease and contributes to our understanding of glioma resistance and recurrence. Revealing cell division characteristics of initiating cell populations within GBM may represent novel treatment targets and/or the effective repurposing of existing therapies. In this review, we discuss the potential role of targeting the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) driving this specific population. We also describe developments using multi-omic approaches that may aid in stratifying patient populations for CDK inhibitor therapy.",,4,1,,703877,Canadian Cancer Society Research Institute

Interspecies effects on oviposition preference have been widely investigated, especially for herbivores. However, intraspecies variation, such as nitrogen content, might also influence female preference for oviposition hosts and subsequent offspring performance. To evaluate this possibility, we investigated the oviposition preference of a zoophytophagous omnivore and the development and survival of its nymphs on a single species of host plant that varied in nitrogen content. In choice and no-choice experiments without prey, female omnivores were allowed to oviposit on plants that had been fertilized using 4 rates of nitrogen fertilizer (39, 78, 156, and 311 mg/L nitrogen) for 72 h. After 72 h, the most females were found on tomato plants receiving high concentrations of nitrogen fertilizer and more eggs were laid on those plants. First instar nymphs developed more rapidly on high-nitrogen plants and third instar nymphs developed faster on low-nitrogen plants. Plant nitrogen did not affect nymph survival to the adult stage, or the probability of survival over time. Although female omnivores did discriminate between potential oviposition hosts based on plant nitrogen, their choices did not significantly impact nymph development or survival. This is the first study to show that intraspecies variation in nitrogen content between plants affects the oviposition preference of female omnivores, but not offspring performance.",biological control | Dicyphus hesperus | Hemiptera | nitrogen | omnivore | optimal oviposition,4,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

We conducted playback experiments to investigate territorial behaviour in male and female White-bellied Wrens (Uropsila leucogastra) in response to simulated conspecific and heterospecific intruders during the breeding and non-breeding seasons. We explored whether heterospecific songs of the Happy Wren (Pheugopedius felix), a distantly related species and ecological competitor, elicited antagonistic responses from focal White-bellied Wrens, and whether such responses differed between the sexes. We also examined whether male and female responses to conspecific and heterospecific rivals varied with season. We found that male White-bellied Wrens always responded to conspecific song, and responded significantly more to heterospecific song compared to a control stimulus (Tropical Parula, Setophaga pitiayumi). In contrast, although female White-bellied Wrens responded strongly to conspecific song, their response to heterospecific song did not differ significantly from the control stimulus. The proportion of males that responded to heterospecific songs and the proportion of females that responded to conspecific songs varied seasonally, showing significantly lower responses during the breeding season. The intense responses of male White-bellied Wrens to playback of heterospecific songs suggest that they recognise ecological competitors based on their vocal signals. Furthermore, the decrease in agonistic interactions during the breeding season is in line with the hypothesis that aggressive behaviour may be detrimental to reproductive and parental activity, and the hypothesis that heterospecific animals pose less of a threat during the breeding season.",interaction | interspecific | playback | season | song | territoriality,0,0,,CONACYT 179877,Government of Ontario

Knowledge of the diet and trophic ecology of apex predators is key for the implementation of effective ecosystem as well as species-based management initiatives. Using a combination of stomach content data and stable isotope analysis (δ15N and δ13C) the current study provides information on size-based and sex-specific variations in diet, trophic position (TP) and foraging habitat of tiger sharks (Galeocerdo cuvier) caught in the KwaZulu-Natal Sharks Board bather protection program. This study presents the longest time-series and most detailed analysis of stomach content data for G. cuvier worldwide. Prey identified from 628 non-empty stomachs revealed a size-based shift in diet. Reptiles, birds, mysticetes, and large shark species increased in dietary importance with G. cuvier size, concomitant with a decrease in smaller prey such as batoids and teleosts. Seasonal and decadal shifts in diet driven primarily by changes in the importance of elasmobranchs and mammal (cetacean) prey were recorded for medium sized (150-220 cm) G. cuvier. Both stomach content and stable isotope analysis indicated that G. cuvier is a generalist feeder at the population level. Size-based δ13C profiles indicated a movement to offshore foraging habitats by larger G. cuvier. Calculated TP varied by method ranging from 4.0 to 5.0 (TPSCA for stomach contents) and from 3.6 to 4.5 (TPscaled and TPadditive for δ15N). Large (> 220 cm) G. cuvier did not feed at discrete trophic levels, but rather throughout the food web. These data provide key information on the ecological role of G. cuvier to improve the accuracy of regional food web modelling. This will enable a better understanding of the ecological impacts related to changes in the abundance of this predator.",,12,1,,undefined,

This paper reviews the use of acoustic telemetry as a tool for addressing issues in fisheries management, and serves as the lead to the special Feature Issue of Ecological Applications titled Acoustic Telemetry and Fisheries Management. Specifically, we provide an overview of the ways in which acoustic telemetry can be used to inform issues central to the ecology, conservation, and management of exploited and/or imperiled fish species. Despite great strides in this area in recent years, there are comparatively few examples where data have been applied directly to influence fisheries management and policy. We review the literature on this issue, identify the strengths and weaknesses of work done to date, and highlight knowledge gaps and difficulties in applying empirical fish telemetry studies to fisheries policy and practice. We then highlight the key areas of management and policy addressed, as well as the challenges that needed to be overcome to do this. We conclude with a set of recommendations about how researchers can, in consultation with stock assessment scientists and managers, formulate testable scientific questions to address and design future studies to generate data that can be used in a meaningful way by fisheries management and conservation practitioners. We also urge the involvement of relevant stakeholders (managers, fishers, conservation societies, etc.) early on in the process (i.e., in the co-creation of research projects), so that all priority questions and issues can be addressed effectively.",acoustic telemetry | applied science | conservation | fish tracking | fisheries biology | policy | resource management,56,0,,undefined,

Background: Edible dry beans (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) that darken during postharvest storage are graded lower and are less marketable than their non-darkened counterparts. Seed coat darkening in susceptible genotypes is dependent upon the availability of proanthocyanidins, and their subsequent oxidation to reactive quinones. Mature cranberry beans lacking this postharvest darkening trait tend to be proanthocyanidin-deficient, although the underlying molecular and biochemical determinants for this metabolic phenomenon are unknown. Results: Seed coat proanthocyanidin levels increased with plant maturation in a darkening-susceptible cranberry bean recombinant inbred line (RIL), whereas these metabolites were absent in seeds of the non-darkening RIL plants. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis was used to monitor changes in the seed coat transcriptome as a function of bean development, where transcript levels were measured as fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped. A total of 1336 genes were differentially expressed between darkening and non-darkening cranberry bean RILs. Structural and regulatory genes of the proanthocyanidin biosynthesis pathway were upregulated in seed coats of the darkening RIL. A principal component analysis determined that changes in transcript levels for two genes of unknown function and three proanthocyanidin biosynthesis genes, FLAVANONE 3-HYDROXYLASE 1, DIHYDROFLAVONOL 4-REDUCTASE 1 and ANTHOCYANIDIN REDUCTASE 1 (PvANR1) were highly correlated with proanthocyanidin accumulation in seed coats of the darkening-susceptible cranberry bean RIL. HPLC-DAD analysis revealed that in vitro activity of a recombinant PvANR1 was NADPH-dependent and assays containing cyanidin yielded epicatechin and catechin; high cyanidin substrate levels inhibited the formation of both of these products. Conclusion: Proanthocyanidin oxidation is a pre-requisite for postharvest-related seed coat darkening in dicotyledonous seeds. In model plant species, the accumulation of proanthocyanidins is dependent upon upregulation of biosynthetic genes. In this study, proanthocyanidin production in cranberry bean seed coats was strongly associated with an increase in PvANR1 transcripts during seed maturation. In the presence of NADPH, PvANR1 converted the physiologically relevant substrate cyanidin to epicatechin and catechin.",Anthocyanidin reductase | Phaseolus vulgaris | Proanthocyanidin | RNA-seq | Seed coat darkening | Transcriptome,8,1,,undefined,

Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) are highly toxic and persistent global pollutants with extremely large differences in sensitivity across taxonomic groups. The chicken has long been considered uniquely sensitive to DLCs among avian species; but DLC toxicity in nondomesticated birds is largely untested, and the relevance of the chicken as an ecological model is uncertain. New approaches that use genotyping of the AHR1 ligand binding domain to screen for DLC sensitivity among avian species predicted that the gray catbird, a relevant wildlife species, is also highly sensitive. We tested this prediction using egg injections of a dioxin-like PCB (PCB-126) and found that the catbird is at least as sensitive as the chicken to DLCs, based on both embryotoxicity and mRNA induction of phase I metabolizing enzymes (CYP1A4/5). This study is the first to confirm that there are wildlife species as sensitive as the chicken and demonstrates how using predictive genotyping methods and targeted bioassays can focus toxicity assessments on ecologically relevant species.",,2,0,,undefined,Environment and Climate Change Canada

To investigate sources of growth variation, we examined the independent and joint effects of paternal reproductive tactic (G) and rearing environment (E) on juvenile growth in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), hypothesizing G and E effects are partially mediated through differences in behaviour such as aggressive interactions and resulting foraging behaviours. We created maternal half-sibling families with one-half of the female's eggs fertilized by the milt of a sneaker “jack” and the other half by a guarder “hooknose”. At the exogenous feeding stage, each split-clutch family was then divided again and reared in a rationed diet or growth-promotion diet environment for approximately 6 months, during which growth parameters were measured. Before saltwater transfer at 9 months of age, social interactions were observed in groups of six fish of various competitor origins. We found ration restricts growth rate and juvenile mass, and evidence of genetic effects on growth depensation, where jack-sired individuals grew less uniformly over time. These growth-related differences influenced an individual's level of aggression, with individuals raised on a restricted diet and those whose families experienced greatest growth being most aggressive. These individuals were more likely to feed than not and feed most often. Jack-sired individuals were additionally aggressive in the absence of food, and when raised on a rationed diet outcompeted others to feed most. These results show how individuals may achieve higher growth rates via intrinsic (G) or induced (E) aggressive behavioural phenotypes, and eventually attain the threshold body size necessary during the saltwater phase to precociously sexually mature and adopt alternative reproductive phenotypes.",aggression | alternative reproductive tactics | foraging | GxE | offspring growth | salmon,1,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Our understanding of population dynamics of organisms entrained in ballast is largely limited to studies of zooplankton and phytoplankton. Bacteria are more numerous and diverse than zooplankton or phytoplankton, yet remain comparatively understudied. We apply a metagenomics approach to characterize changes in the microbial ballast water community over the course of three voyages on one ship, and assess the effects of ballast water exchange (BWE), spring/summer sampling month and time since voyage start. Location: Quebec City and Deception Bay, Quebec, and the coastal marine region offshore of eastern Canada. Methods: We used universal primers to Ion Torrent sequence a fragment of the bacterial 16S ribosomal DNA for samples collected over three voyages of one ship between Quebec City and Deception Bay in June, July and August 2015. We compared richness (total number of species in the community) and diversity (accounts for both species abundance and evenness) using linear mixed-effects analysis and compared community composition using non-metric multidimensional scaling and permutational multivariate analysis of variance. Initial comparisons were between months. Subsequent analyses focused on each month separately. Results: Ion Torrent sequencing returned c. 2.9 million reads and revealed monthly differences in diversity and richness, and in community structure in ballast water. June had higher richness and diversity than either July or August, and showed most clearly the effect of BWE on the microbial community. Main conclusions: Our results suggest that environmental conditions associated with different spring/summer sampling months drive differences in microbial diversity in ballast water. This study showed that BWE removes some components of the freshwater starting microbial community and replaces them with other taxa.

However, most studies used eDNA analysis in lentic systems (ponds or lakes), or in controlled laboratory experiments. While eDNA degrades rapidly in all aquatic systems, it also undergoes dilution effects and physical destruction in flowing systems, complicating detection in rivers. However, some eDNA (i.e. residual eDNA) can be retained in aquatic systems, even those subject to high flow regimes. Our goal was to determine residual eDNA detection sensitivity using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR), in a flowing, uncontrolled river after the eDNA source was removed from the system; we repeated the experiment over 2 years. Residual eDNA had the strongest signal strength at the original source site and was detectable there up to 11.5 h after eDNA source removal. Residual eDNA signal strength decreased as sampling distance downstream from the eDNA source site increased, and was no longer detectable at the source site 48 h after the eDNA source water was exhausted in both experiments. This experiment shows that residual eDNA sampled in surface water can be mapped quantitatively using qRT–PCR, which allows a more accurate spatial identification of the target species location in lotic systems, and relative residual eDNA signal strength may allow the determination of the timing of the presence of target species.",DNA persistence | environmental DNA | qRT–PCR | residual | river,13,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

This process promotes genetic divergence between populations, and given enough time, may yield new species. Animals that inhabit mid-elevation or highland habitats may be disproportionately affected in this way. Genetic analyses of animals in this region allow us to better understand how historical patterns of isolation have influenced the generation of new species in this biodiversity hotspot. We studied the biogeography and systematics of two closely related genera of sparrows (Passerellidae): Melozone and Aimophila. Collectively, this group is distributed from the southwestern United States and southward as far as central Costa Rica. We sampled 81 individuals of 8 Melozone and 2 Aimophila species, from 19 localities distributed throughout their ranges. We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships and time-calibrated species trees using multilocus sequence data comprised of one mitochondrial gene and five nuclear genes. We conducted an ancestral area reconstruction analysis to determine the probability of ancestral range at each divergent event. Despite analyzing six loci, we were unable to obtain a fully resolved phylogenetic tree. We recovered four main lineages: lineage 1 includes four Melozone species distributed north of Isthmus of Tehuantepec (M. albicollis, M. crissalis, M. aberti, M. fusca); lineage 2 includes three Melozone species distributed south of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec (M. biarcuata, M. cabanisi, M. leucotis); lineage 3 lineage consists of a single species endemic to the Pacific coast of Mexico (M. kieneri); and lineage 4 includes the more widely distributed sparrows in the genus Aimophila. Our analyses suggest that these genera probably originated during the late Miocene in the Madrean Highlands of southern Mexico. We identified dispersal as the prevalent cause of speciation in this clade with most lineages dispersing to their current distributions from southern Mexico either to the north following a developing and expanding Madro-Tertiary flora, or to the south across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. A similar pattern of dispersal from this biogeographic region has been reported in other taxa including fishes, reptiles, and birds. Our results reveal that the four lineages identified represent geographically coherent and ecologically similar assemblages of taxa.

In seasonal ice environments, there is evidence that polar bear predation of Arctic bird eggs is increasing because of earlier sea ice breakup, which forces polar bears into nearshore terrestrial environments where Arctic birds are nesting. Because polar bears can consume a large number of nests before becoming satiated, and because they can swim between island colonies, they could have dramatic influences on seabird and sea duck reproductive success. However, it is unclear whether nest foraging can provide an energetic benefit to polar bear populations, especially given the capacity of bird populations to redistribute in response to increasing predation pressure. In this study, we develop a spatially explicit agent-based model of the predator–prey relationship between polar bears and common eiders, a common and culturally important bird species for northern peoples. Our model is composed of two types of agents (polar bear agents and common eider hen agents) whose movements and decision heuristics are based on species-specific bioenergetic and behavioral ecological principles, and are influenced by historical and extrapolated sea ice conditions. Our model reproduces empirical findings that polar bear predation of bird nests is increasing and predicts an accelerating relationship between advancing ice breakup dates and the number of nests depredated. Despite increases in nest predation, our model predicts that polar bear body condition during the ice-free period will continue to decline. Finally, our model predicts that common eider nests will become more dispersed and will move closer to the mainland in response to increasing predation, possibly increasing their exposure to land-based predators and influencing the livelihood of local people that collect eider eggs and down. These results show that predator–prey interactions can have nonlinear responses to changes in climate and provides important predictions of ecological change in Arctic ecosystems.",agent-based model | Arctic | biological interaction | climate change | ecological forecast | foraging | individual based-model,8,0,,undefined,Environment and Climate Change Canada

Therefore, the perspective of male influence on early life history traits has come under scrutiny. This study was conducted to determine parental effects on the rate of eyed embryos of Ide Leuciscus idus and Northern pike Esox lucius. Five sires and five dams from each species were crossed using a quantitative genetic breeding design and the resulting 25 sib groups of each species were reared to the embryonic eyed stage. We then partition variation in embryonic phenotypic performance to maternal, paternal, and parental interactions using the Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) model. Results showed that paternal, maternal, and the paternal × maternal interaction terms were highly significant for both species; clearly demonstrating that certain family combinations were more compatible than others. Paternal effects explained 20.24% of the total variance, which was 2-fold higher than the maternal effects (10.73%) in Ide, while paternal effects explained 18.9% of the total variance, which was 15-fold higher than the maternal effects (1.3%) in Northern pike. Together, these results indicate that male effects are of major importance during embryonic development for these species.

Mechanisms driving selection of body size and growth rate in wild marine vertebrates are poorly understood, thus limiting knowledge of their fitness costs at ecological, physiological and genetic scales. Here, we indirectly tested whether selection for size-related traits of juvenile sharks that inhabit a nursery hosting two dichotomous habitats, protected mangroves (low predation risk) and exposed seagrass beds (high predation risk), is influenced by their foraging behaviour. Juvenile sharks displayed a continuum of foraging strategies between mangrove and seagrass areas, with some individuals preferentially feeding in one habitat over another. Foraging habitat was correlated with growth rate, whereby slower growing, smaller individuals fed predominantly in sheltered mangroves, whereas larger, faster growing animals fed over exposed seagrass. Concomitantly, tracked juveniles undertook variable movement behaviours across both the low and high predation risk habitat. These data provide supporting evidence for the hypothesis that directional selection favouring smaller size and slower growth rate, both heritable traits in this shark population, may be driven by variability in foraging behaviour and predation risk. Such evolutionary pathways may be critical to adaptation within predator-driven marine ecosystems.",Food web | Lemon shark | Life history | Natural selection | Predation risk | Stable isotopes,6,1,,undefined,

Background: Branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs) are synthesized by plants, fungi, bacteria, and archaea with plants being the major source of these amino acids in animal diets. Acetolactate synthase (ALS) is the first enzyme in the BCAA synthesis pathway. Although the functional contribution of ALS to BCAA biosynthesis has been extensively characterized, a comprehensive understanding of the regulation of this pathway at the molecular level is still lacking. Results: To characterize the regulatory processes governing ALS activity we utilized several complementary approaches. Using the ALS catalytic protein subunit as bait we performed a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) screen which resulted in the identification of a set of interacting proteins, two of which (denoted as ALS-INTERACTING PROTEIN1 and 3 [AIP1 and AIP3, respectively]) were found to be evolutionarily conserved orthologues of bacterial feedback-regulatory proteins and therefore implicated in the regulation of ALS activity. To investigate the molecular role AIPs might play in BCAA synthesis in Arabidopsis thaliana, we examined the functional contribution of aip1 and aip3 knockout alleles to plant patterning and development and BCAA synthesis under various growth conditions. Loss-of-function genetic backgrounds involving these two genes exhibited differential aberrant growth responses in valine-, isoleucine-, and sodium chloride-supplemented media. While BCAA synthesis is believed to be localized to the chloroplast, both AIP1 and AIP3 were found to localize to the peroxisome in addition to the chloroplast. Analysis of free amino acid pools in the mutant backgrounds revealed that they differ in the absolute amount of individual BCAAs accumulated and exhibit elevated levels of BCAAs in leaf tissues. Despite the phenotypic differences observed in aip1 and aip3 backgrounds, functional redundancy between these loci was suggested by the finding that aip1/aip3 double knockout mutants are severely developmentally compromised. Conclusions: Taken together the data suggests that the two regulatory proteins, in conjunction with ALS, have overlapping but distinct functions in BCAA synthesis, and also play a role in pathways unrelated to BCAA synthesis such as sodium-ion homeostasis, extending to broader aspects of patterning and development.",Acetolactate synthase | AHAS | ALS | Branched-chain amino acids | Isoleucine | Leucine | Valine,2,1,,undefined,

Carotenoids provide animals with many fitness benefits through increased mating success, immune function, gamete quality, and antioxidant capacity. Despite these benefits, carotenoids are not utilized equally by all animals, implying trade-offs associated with the pigments; although, few studies have quantified fitness costs of carotenoid pigmentation. Salmon are known for their conspicuous red coloration; however, amongst Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), a natural genetic color polymorphism exists (red and white morphs) which results in carotenoid-based color differences in eggs and other tissues. Although the fitness benefit of egg carotenoid content on egg incubation survival has been demonstrated, carotenoid pigmentation also results in highly visible eggs vulnerable to predation. Therefore, although white Chinook salmon eggs experience costs in terms of viability, a potential benefit in terms of reduced predation could help explain the maintenance of the polymorphism. Here, using red and white eggs from wild Chinook salmon, we show that increased carotenoid content of salmon eggs leads to greater predation risk. We found that 2 populations of wild-type rainbow trout (O. mykiss; an ecologically relevant predator) showed a significant bias for red eggs over white eggs under choice experiments, where red eggs were consumed first twice as often and significantly faster than white eggs. Our study suggests that trade-offs between red and white Chinook salmon during the egg stage provide an evolutionary mechanism promoting the maintenance of the unique Chinook salmon color polymorphism in nature, while also, for the first time, demonstrating a direct fitness cost of carotenoids in salmon.",Carotenoids | Chinook salmon | Color polymorphism | Egg predation | Rainbow trout | Trade-offs,2,1,,undefined,

Many animals gather in large groups to mate. When these animals produce sexual signals, their signals may overlap. The signal enhancement hypothesis proposes that overlapping signals exhibit enhanced transmission properties, increasing the active space and potency of the signal. We tested this hypothesis using multispeaker playback to simulate a chorus of explosively breeding Neotropical Yellow Toads (Incilius luetkenii). We varied the number of simulated males and the frequency of their vocalizations and we rerecorded the choruses at different distances through this species' native habitat in Costa Rica. Our results support the signal enhancement hypothesis: Transmission distance increased with the number of simultaneous calls. Call frequency varies inversely with body size in many animals, including Yellow Toads, and our results reveal that the signal enhancement effect of overlapping calls is heightened when the calls are low in frequency (i.e., a chorus of large-bodied animals) compared to medium or high frequency (i.e., a chorus of smaller-bodied animals).

Labeling olfactory sensory neurons with anti-keyhole limpet hemocyanin (anti-KLH) revealed seven spatially conserved glomerular territories visible at hatch and well established by the late yolk-sac larva developmental stage.

In this study, insight into the basal pattern of neural organization of the vertebrate olfactory bulb was gained by investigating the lamprey. Retrograde labelling established that lateral and dorsal bulbar territories receive the axons of sensory neurons broadly distributed in the main olfactory epithelium and that the medial region receives sensory neuron input only from neurons projecting from the accessory olfactory organ. The response duration for local field potential recordings was similar in the lateral and dorsal regions, and both were longer than medial responses. All three regions responded to amino acid odorants. The dorsal and medial regions, but not the lateral region, responded to steroids.

The objective of this study was to determine the effect of seminal plasma on sperm velocity of male Chinook salmon (Onchorhynchus tshawytscha), which possesses a mating system with male alternative reproductive tactics and intense sperm competition. Male Chinook salmon either adopt a small, precocious sneaking tactic (jack) or a large, dominant tactic (hooknose). To test whether the seminal plasma can effect sperm velocity amongst sperm competitors, two experiments were done whereby males were paired based upon the alternative tactic each male adopted, with the first experiment consisting of jack-hooknose pairs (N = 16) and the second experiment consisting of jack-jack and hooknose-hooknose pairs (N = 12 and 14, respectively). Within each pair, milt of each male was manipulated such that seminal plasma was removed and swapped between the males in each pair and sperm velocity was measured. Jack seminal plasma caused a significant decrease (∼11.9%) in hooknose sperm velocity while causing a significant increase in jack sperm velocity (∼7%), while alternatively, hooknose seminal plasma had no affect on sperm velocity of jack or other hooknose males. This study shows that rival seminal plasma may affect the outcome of sperm competition between males; males adopting a sneaking tactic, that spawn in a disadvantageous mating position, may be able to compensate for this deficit by being more competitive through the effects of their seminal plasma on their competitor's sperm velocity.",Mating system | Sexual selection | Sneaker | Sperm competition,9,0,,807006,Ontario Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry

Feather corticosterone (CORT) levels are increasingly employed as biomarkers of environmental stress. However, it is unclear if feather CORT levels reflect stress and/or workload in the wild. We investigated whether feather CORT represents a biomarker of environmental stress and reproductive effort in tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). Specifically, we examined whether individual state and investment during reproduction could predict feather CORT levels in subsequently moulted feathers and whether those levels could predict future survival and reproductive success. Through a manipulation of flight cost during breeding, we also investigated whether an increase in stress level would be reflected in subsequently grown feathers, and whether those levels could predict future success. We found that CORT levels of feathers grown during moult did not (1) reflect past breeding experience (n = 29), (2) predict reproductive output (n = 18), or (3) respond to a manipulation of flight effort during reproduction (10 experimental, 14 control females). While higher feather CORT levels predicted higher return rate (a proxy for survival), they did so only in the manipulated group (n = 36), and this relationship was opposite to expected. Overall, our results add to the mixed literature reporting that feather CORT levels can be positively, negatively, or not related to proxies of within-season and longer-term fitness (i.e., carryover effects). In addition, our results indicate that CORT levels or disturbances experienced during one time (e.g., breeding) may not carry over to subsequent stages (e.g., moult). We, therefore, petition for directed research investigating whether feather CORT represents exposure to chronic stress in feathers grown during moult.",fCORT | Feather clipping | Glucocorticoid | Moult | Tree swallow,3,0,,29401,Canada Foundation for Innovation

This widespread behavioural phenomenon occurs because strangers represent a threat to both an animal's territory and parentage, whereas neighbours represent a threat only to parentage. Recent research in birds demonstrates some flexibility in the dear enemy effect across the breeding season. Given that neighbours often sire extrapair young, male animals may benefit by responding more aggressively to neighbours during periods of female fertility. Here we investigate the hypothesis that the dear enemy effect varies with female fertility by testing the prediction that male birds will respond more strongly to neighbours when their own mates are fertile than when they are not fertile. We conducted a playback experiment with wild song sparrows, Melospiza melodia, repeating playback sessions to paired territorial males over the course of a breeding season, including periods when females were fertile and periods when they were not. Male song sparrows displayed a dear enemy effect only when their social mate was not fertile. We conclude that male song sparrows adjust behaviour towards neighbours based on their own mate's fertility status, presumably because neighbours threaten a territorial male's parentage during his breeding partner's fertile period. When paternity is not at stake, reduced aggression towards neighbours may enhance fitness, but when paternity is at stake, normal levels of aggression towards neighbours may be favoured as a mate-guarding tactic.",dear enemy effect | fertility status | fitness | mate guarding | Melospiza melodia | neighbour–stranger discrimination | paternity | song sparrow | territoriality,5,0,,undefined,Queen's University

All rights reserved. Background: The North American Great Lakes are home to > 140 types of fish and are famous for recreational and commercial fishing. However, the presence of toxic substances has resulted in the issuance of fish consumption advisories that are typically based on the most restrictive contaminant. Objectives: We investigated whether these advisories, which typically neglect the existence of a mixture of chemicals and their possible additive adverse effects, are adequately protective of the health of humans consuming fish from the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes. Methods: Using recent fish contaminant monitoring data collected by the government of Ontario, Canada, we simulated advisories using most-restrictive-contaminant (one-chem) and multi-contaminant additive effect (multi-chem) approaches. The advisories from the two simulations were compared to determine if there is any deficiency in the currently issued advisories. Results: Approximately half of the advisories currently issued are potentially not adequately protective. Of the four Great Lakes studied, the highest percentage of advisories affected are in Lake Ontario if an additive effect is considered. Many fish that are popular for consumption, such as walleye, salmon, bass and trout, would have noticeably more stringent advisories. Conclusions: Improvements in the advisories may be needed to ensure that the health of humans consuming fish from the Great Lakes is protected. In this region, total polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury are the major contaminants causing restrictions on consuming fish, whereas dioxins/furans, toxaphene, and mirex/photomirex are of minor concern. Regular monitoring of most organochlorine pesticides and metals in fish can be discontinued.",,7,0,,undefined,

We investigated the physiology of two closely related albatross species relative to their breeding strategy: black-browed albatrosses (Thalassarche melanophris) breed annually, while grey-headed albatrosses (T. chrysostoma) breed biennially. From observations of breeding fate and blood samples collected at the end of breeding in one season and feather corticosterone levels (fCort) sampled at the beginning of the next breeding season, we found that in both species some post-breeding physiological parameters differed according to breeding outcome (successful, failed, deferred). Correlations between post-breeding physiology and fCort, and links to future breeding decisions, were examined. In black-browed albatrosses, post-breeding physiology and fCort were not significantly correlated, but fCort independently predicted breeding decision the next year, which we interpret as a possible migratory carry-over effect. In grey-headed albatrosses, post-breeding triglyceride levels were negatively correlated with fCort, but only in females, which we interpret as a potential cost of reproduction. However, this potential cost did not carry-over to future breeding in the grey-headed albatrosses. None of the variables predicted future breeding decisions. We suggest that biennial breeding in the grey-headed albatrosses may have evolved as a strategy to buffer against the apparent susceptibility of females to negative physiological costs of reproduction.

Management boundaries that define populations or stocks of fish form the basis of fisheries planning. In the Arctic, decreasing sea ice extent is driving increasing fisheries development, highlighting the need for ecological data to inform management. In Cumberland Sound, southwest Baffin Island, an indigenous community fishery was established in 1987 targeting Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) through the ice. Following its development, the Cumberland Sound Management Boundary (CSMB) was designated and a total allowable catch (TAC) assigned to the fishery. The CSMB was based on a sink population of Greenland halibut resident in the northern section of the Sound. Recent fishing activities south of the CSMB, however, raised concerns over fish residency, the effectiveness of the CSMB and the sustainability of the community-based winter fishery. Through acoustic telemetry monitoring at depths between 400 and 1200 m, and environmental and fisheries data, this study examined the movement patterns of Greenland halibut relative to the CSMB, the biotic and abiotic factors driving fish movement and the dynamics of the winter fishery. Greenland halibut undertook clear seasonal movements between the southern and northern regions of the Sound driven by temperature, dissolved oxygen, and sea ice cover with most fish crossing the CSMB on an annual basis. Over the lifespan of the fishery, landfast ice cover initially declined and then became variable, limiting accessibility to favored fisher locations. Concomitantly, catch per unit effort declined, reflecting the effect of changing ice conditions on the location and effort of the fishery. Ultimately, these telemetry data revealed that fishers now target less productive sites outside of their favored areas and, with continued decreases in ice, the winter fishery might cease to exist. In addition, these novel telemetry data revealed that the CSMB is ineffective and led to its relocation to the entrance of the Sound in 2014. The community fishery can now develop an open-water fishery in addition to the winter fishery to exploit the TAC, which will ensure the longevity of the fishery under projected climate-change scenarios. Telemetry shows great promise as a tool for understanding deep-water species and for directly informing fisheries management of these ecosystems that are inherently complex to study.",acoustic telemetry | Canadian Arctic | catch per unit effort | declining ice cover | fisher location | fisheries planning | Reinhardtius hippoglossoides,18,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

In polar seas, the seasonal melting of ice triggers the development of an open-water ecosystem characterized by short-lived algal blooms, the grazing and development of zooplankton, and the influx of avian and mammalian predators. Spatial heterogeneity in the timing of ice melt generates temporal variability in the development of these events across the habitat, offering a natural framework to assess how foraging marine predators respond to the spring phenology. We combined 4 yr of tracking data of Antarctic petrels Thalassoica antarctica with synoptic remote-sensing data on sea ice and chlorophyll a to test how the development of melting ice and primary production drive Antarctic petrel foraging. Cross-correlation analyses of first-passage time revealed that Antarctic petrels utilized foraging areas with a spatial scale of 300 km. These areas changed position or disappeared within 10 to 30 d and showed no spatial consistency among years. Generalized additive model (GAM) analyses suggested that the presence of foraging areas was related to the time since ice melt. Antarctic petrels concentrated their search effort in melting areas and in areas that had reached an age of 50 to 60 d from the date of ice melt. We found no significant relationship between search effort and chlorophyll a concentration. We suggest that these foraging patterns were related to the vertical distribution and profitability of the main prey, the Antarctic krill Euphausia superba. Our study demonstrates that the annual ice melt in the Southern Ocean shapes the development of a highly patchy and elusive food web, underscoring the importance of flexible foraging strategies among top predators.",Area-restricted search | Euphausia superba | Marginal ice zone | Phytoplankton biomass | Procellariiformes | Sea ice dynamics | Southern Ocean | Thalassoica antarctica,2,1,,undefined,

Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) are external fertilizers that display sneak-guard alternative reproductive tactics. The larger hooknose males dominate mating positions, while the smaller jack males utilize sneak tactics to achieve fertilization. Although poorly understood, previous studies have suggested that differences in spermatozoa quality may play a critical role in sperm competition. Considering that the seminal plasma strongly regulates spermatozoa quality and other processes critical for fertilization success, we employed label free quantitative mass spectrometry utilizing ion mobility separation coupled to cross-species bioinformatics to examine the seminal plasma proteome of Chinook salmon. A total of 345 proteins were identified in all biological replicates analyzed, including many established seminal plasma proteins that may serve as future biomarkers for Chinook salmon fertility and sperm competition. Moreover, we elucidated statistically significant protein abundance differences between hooknose and jack male tactics. Proteins involved in membrane remodeling, proteolysis, hormonal transport, redox regulation, immunomodulation, and ATP metabolism were among the proteins reproducibly identified at different levels and represent putative factors influencing sperm competition between jack and hooknose males. This study represents the largest seminal plasma proteome from teleost fish and the first reported for Chinook salmon. Significance Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) males represent an example of male alternative reproductive tactics where diverse reproductive strategies are thought to increase sexual selection. While seminal plasma has been shown to play an important regulatory role in sperm competition in many species, little is known about the protein composition of the seminal plasma of salmon. Therefore, seminal plasma isolated from the two alternative reproductive tactics of Chinook salmon (small sneaky jacks and large dominant hooknoses) were analyzed by label free quantitative mass spectrometry employing data independent acquisition and ion mobility separation. This yielded the largest proteome data set of the seminal plasma from salmon and the first to examine protein abundance differences between male alternative reproductive tactics. The quantitative proteomic data provides insight into possible unique mechanistic aspects of Chinook salmon alternative reproductive tactics utilized for sperm competition and fertilization success.",Fertility | Ion mobility | Proteomics | Salmon | Seminal plasma | Sperm competition | Spermatogenesis,9,0,,397997-2011,University of Windsor

These SQGs are useful for a screening line of evidence (LOE) that can be combined with other LOEs in a full weight of evidence (WOE) assessment of impacted sites. Three common multichemical hazard quotient methods (probable effect concentration [PEC]-Q avg , PEC-Q met , and PEC-Q sum ) and a novel (hazard score [HZD]) approach were used in conjunction with a consensus-based set of SQGs to evaluate the ability of different scoring metrics to predict the biological effects of sediment contamination under field conditions. Multivariate analyses were first used to categorize river sediments into distinct habitats based on a set of physicochemical parameters to include gravel, low and high flow sand, and silt. For high flow sand and gravel, no significant dose–response relationships between numerically dominant species and various toxicity metric scores were observed. Significant dose–response relationships were observed for chironomid abundances and toxicity scores in low flow sand and silt habitats. For silt habitats, the HZD scoring metric provided the best predictor of chironomid abundances compared to various PEC-Q methods according to goodness-of-fit tests. For low flow sand habitats, PEC-Q sum followed by HZD, provided the best predictors of chironomid abundance. Differences in apparent chironomid toxicity between the 2 habitats suggest habitat-specific differences in chemical bioavailability and indicator taxa sensitivity. Using an IBI method, the HZD, PEC-Q avg , and PEC-Q met approaches provided reasonable correlations with calculated IBI values in both silt and low flow sand habitats but not for gravel or high flow sands. Computation differences between the various multi-chemical toxicity scoring metrics and how this contributes to bias in different estimates of chemical mixture toxicity scores are discussed and compared.

Avian basal metabolic rate (BMR) and summit metabolic rate (Msum) vary in parallel during cold acclimation and acclimatization, which implies a functional link between these variables. However, evidence suggests that these parameters may reflect different physiological systems acting independently. We tested this hypothesis in white-throated sparrows (Zonotrichia albicol-lis) acclimated to two temperatures (28° and 28°C) and two diets (0% and 30% cellulose). We expected to find an uncoupling of Msum and BMR where Msum, a measure of maximal shivering heat production, would reflect muscle and heart mass variation and would respond only to temperature, while BMR would reflect changes in digestive and excretory organs inresponse to daily food intake, responding to both temperature and diet. We found that the gizzard, liver, kidneys, and intestines responded to treatments through a positive relationship with food intake. BMR was 15% higher in cold-acclimated birds and, as expected, varied with food intake and the mass of digestive and excretory organs. In contrast, although Msum was 19% higher in cold-acclimated birds, only heart massresponded totemperature(118%inthecold). Pectoral muscles did not change in mass with temperature but were 8.2% lighter on the cellulose diet. Nevertheless, Msum varied positively with the mass of heart and skeletal muscles but only in cold-acclimated birds. Our results therefore suggest that an upregulation of muscle metabolic intensity is required for cold acclimation. This study increases support for the hypothesis that BMR and Msum reflect different physiological systems responding in parallel to constraints associated with cold environments.",Basal metabolic rate | Body composition | Diet | Metabolic performance | Summit metabolic rate | Temperature | Zonotrichia albicollis,7,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

BACKGROUND: Enriching hydrogen (H2)-producing bacteria by suppressing methane-producing microorganisms is a critical step in continuous biological H2 production. Selective inhibition of methanogens can be achieved by varying the organic loading rate (OLR) in continuous reactors. In this study, continuous H2 production was examined using mixed anaerobic cultures fed glucose in upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactors (UASBRs) operating at 37∘C and at pH 5.0 by varying the OLR at a constant hydraulic retention time. RESULTS: A stable H2 yield of 1.64 ± 0.04 mol mol−1 glucose was obtained at OLRs from 8.6 to 12.8 g COD L−1 d−1. Increasing the OLR increased the hydrogenase flux and suppressed methanogenesis. At high OLRs, high acetate and solvent production were associated with Clostridiaceae and Ruminococcaceae while at low OLRs, the presence of Synergistaceae and Propionibacteriaceae were related to the production of propionate and other reduced byproducts. CONCLUSION: This study successfully demonstrated continuous H2 production using bench-scale UASBRs fed glucose. Understanding the OLR effect on H2 production and microbial interaction is important in the full-scale operation of H2 production facilities using low value feedstocks such as switch grass, corn stover and shorghum.",Biohydrogen | Flux balance analysis | Organic loading rate | Pyrosequencing | Upflow anaerobic sludge blanket reactor,6,0,NSERC,13320,University of Windsor

For migratory species, acquisition and allocation of energy after arrival on the breeding grounds largely determine reproductive decisions. Few studies have investigated underlying physiological mechanisms driving variation in breeding phenology so far. We linked physiological state to individual timing of breeding in pre-laying arctic-nesting female peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus tundrius). We captured females from two populations 2–20 days before egg-laying to assess plasma concentration of β-hydroxybutyric acid (BUTY) and triglyceride (TRIG), two metabolites known to reflect short-term changes in fasting and fattening rate, respectively. We also assessed baseline corticosterone (CORTb), a hormone that mediates energy allocation, and the scaled mass index (SMI) as an indicator of somatic body reserves. Plasma BUTY was slightly higher during the pre-recruiting period compared to the period of rapid follicular growth, indicating a reduction in catabolism of lipid reserves before investment in follicle development. Conversely, TRIG levels increased in pre-recruiting females, and best-predicted individual variation in pre-laying interval and lay date. A marked increase in CORTb occurred concomitantly with the onset of rapid follicle growth. SMI was highly variable possibly reflecting variation in food availability or individuals at different stages. Results suggest that (1) lower rates of pre-laying fattening and/or lower mobilization rate of lipoproteins to ovarian follicles delayed laying, and (2) an elevation in pre-laying CORTb may result from, or be required to compensate for, the energetic costs of egg production. Results of this study illustrate how variation in the allocation of energy before laying can influence individual fitness-related reproductive decisions.",Corticosterone | Energy allocation | Peregrine falcon | Triglyceride | β-Hydroxybutyric acid,2,0,AANDC,AF,Mitacs

All rights reserved. In winter, temperate resident birds are often faced with periodic low natural food availability. This reduction or unpredictability in resource availability might then have a negative impact on immune function, given that immune system support is highly resource dependent. We investigated the balance between energetic and immune management in captive black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapilus) by manipulating the predictability of resources. The control group received food ad lib. every day, while the experimental group received a reduced amount of food on random days and food ad lib. on all other days. We measured two key metrics of energetic management (body and fat mass) as well as a suite of immune system components. Compared with control birds, experimental birds maintained significantly higher total body and fat mass, had lower acute phase protein concentrations, and had decreased body temperature and lost more body mass during the fever response following injection with lipopolysaccharides. Interestingly, birds in both groups had similar levels of complement lysis, delayed-type hypersensitivity response (phytohemagglutinin), and primary antibody production (keyhole limpet hemocyanin). This experiment demonstrates that black-capped chickadees strategically increase their fat mass in response to decreased food availability and that this might allow the birds to maintain most of the immune system unaltered, except some of the most costly immune components.",Black-capped chickadee | Body condition | Complement | Fat | Food unpredictability | Haptoglobin | Immune function,7,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Rationale: Stable isotopes are a prominent tool in animal ecology where data is obtained from analyzing animal tissues, which are typically stored prior to analysis. However, the effect of decomposition on the reliability of stable isotope ratios from animal tissue prior to storage has been seldom studied. Here, we examine the long-term effects of freezing and decomposition of animal tissue on δ13C and δ15N values across three different aquatic species of varying lipid content. Methods: Ringed seal, lake trout and Greenland shark muscle were divided into different treatment groups and analyzed for their δ13C values, carbon content (%C), δ15N values, and nitrogen content (%N) at specific time intervals. The intervals included days 0, 128 and 700 for the frozen storage treatment and at days 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128 and 256 for the tissue decomposition treatment in open and closed vials at room temperature. Results: The difference in δ13C and δ15N values between the control and days 128 and 700 for the frozen treatment was minimal and not significant for any species. Generally, significant decreases in carbon (%C) and nitrogen (%N) content and significant increases (>0.5‰) in δ13C and δ15N values occurred for muscle of each species left to decompose for 256 days, probably due to the preferential uptake of lighter isotopes during decomposition by microbes. However, the magnitude of change in the δ13C and δ15N values up to 8 days in both treatments was low (generally ≤0.1‰) and not significant across most species. Conclusions: Freezing for extended time periods (up to 700 days) is a viable storage technique for stable isotope analysis of aquatic animal muscle tissue across a range of lipid contents. Muscle tissue left to decompose at room temperature showed no significant change in δ13C and δ15N values after 8 days, and such tissues would still be reliable for ecological interpretations. However, caution should be used for decomposed tissue for >8 days as the δ13C and δ15N values will probably be artificially high. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,4,0,,undefined,

We analyzed changes in environmental, additive genetic, and non-additive genetic contributions in growth and saltwater survival across multiple life stages of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) in an aquaculture facility to assess the importance of each factor throughout life. We used a full-factorial breeding design and followed fish for their entire 3-year life cycle to quantify the dam and sire effect on growth and survival and partition these effects into the respective environmental and genetic components. We show for body size that maternal and non-additive effects are the most important drivers of larval size, explaining a total of 87% of total larval phenotypic variation, but decline with age. Additive genetic effects peak during the juvenile stage, explaining a maximum of 15% of the total variation in size, but are much less important at earlier and later life stages. We saw a similar pattern to saltwater survival—with non-additive effects high (42% of total variance explained) at the earliest stage measured and decreasing in later stages and additive effects playing little role. Unlike growth, there was little maternal influence on survival. Taken together, our results show that maternal and non-additive effects are important drivers of larval size but that additive effects may play a more important role with age. Non-additive effects explained the most phenotypic variance observed for survival, playing a much larger role than maternal or additive effects. Our results add to a growing body of literature suggesting careful crosses of select lines can lead to enhanced growth and survival and that these effects can be tailored to the life stages of most concern for a given system. In this way hatchery managers can best develop breeding lines for specific systems and these lines can have stable effects over many generations.

Many ecosystems have experienced anthropogenically induced changes in biodiversity, yet predicting these patterns has been difficult. Recently, individual behavioural and physiological measures have been proposed as more rapid links between environmental variation and fitness compared to demographics. Glucocorticoid hormones have received much attention given that they mediate energetic demands, metabolism, and foraging behaviour. However, it is currently unclear whether glucocorticoids can reliably predict environmental and fitness-related traits and whether they may be useful in specific groups of taxa. In particular, seabirds are a well-studied avian group often employed as biomonitoring tools for environmental change given their wide distribution and reliance on large oceanic patterns. Despite the increase in studies attempting to link variation in baseline corticosterone (the primary avian glucocorticoid) to variation in fitness-related traits in seabirds, there has been no comprehensive review of the relationship in this taxon. We present a phylogenetically controlled systematic review and meta-analysis of correlative and experimental studies examining baseline corticosterone as a predictor of fitness-related traits relevant to predicting seabird population health. Our results suggest that, while variation in baseline corticosterone may be a useful predictor of larger-scale environmental traits such as overall food availability and fitness-related traits such as reproductive success, this hormone may not be sensitive enough to detect variation in body condition, foraging effort, and breeding effort. Overall, our results support recent work suggesting that the use of baseline glucocorticoids as conservation biomarkers is complex and highly context dependent, and we suggest caution in their use and interpretation as simplified, direct biomarkers of fitness.",Biomarker | Cort-fitness | Food availability | Glucocorticoids | Seabirds | Systematic review,13,0,CFI,29401,Canada Foundation for Innovation

Thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a basic carboxypeptidase zymogen present in blood plasma. Proteolytic activation of TAFI by thrombin, thrombin in complex with the endothelial cell cofactor thrombomodulin, or plasmin results in an enzyme (TAFIa) that removes carboxyl-terminal lysine residues from protein and peptide substrates, including cell-surface plasminogen receptors. TAFIa is therefore capable of inhibiting plasminogen activation in the pericellular milieu. Since plasminogen activation has been linked to angiogenesis, TAFIa could therefore have anti-angiogenic properties, and indeed TAFIa has been shown to inhibit endothelial tube formation in a fibrin matrix. In this study, the TAFI pathway was manipulated by providing exogenous TAFI or TAFIa or by adding a potent and specific inhibitor of TAFIa. We found that TAFIa elicited a series of anti-angiogenic responses by endothelial cells, including decreased endothelial cell proliferation, cell invasion, cell migration, tube formation, and collagen degradation. Moreover, TAFIa decreased tube formation and proteolysis in endothelial cell culture grown alone and in co-culture with breast cancer cell lines. In accordance with these findings, inhibition of TAFIa increased secretion of matrix metalloprotease proenzymes by endothelial and breast cancer cells.

In such contexts signal masking is likely and animals would benefit by adopting behavioural strategies that modify the timing of signals to minimize the negative effects of masking or take advantage of its signalling value. Indeed, temporal coordination has been commonly described in a wide variety of taxa, but compelling evidence demonstrating that it arises as an active process is scarce. Here we investigate the degree of coordinated singing by lekking long-billed hermit hummingbirds, Phaethornis longirostris, in the Neotropics, using randomization tests to study the timing of vocal signals. We first demonstrate that a randomization statistical approach is robust at detecting coordinated singing in simulated data. Then, we show that long-billed hermits engage in vocal interactions in which either song alternation or song overlap is used. Furthermore, we show that singing behaviour varies with the distance between singers: hermits alternate their songs when they are in close proximity, and they overlap songs at farther distances. Birds achieve these two behaviours by modifying the time intervals between signals. The association between pattern of coordination and distance is not fully explained by any of the current hypotheses for song overlap and suggests that multiple context-dependent singing strategies could be involved. Our findings provide compelling evidence on vocal coordination as an active process in this species and validate an analytical approach that could be extended to investigate similar patterns in other taxa.",animal communication | context-dependent strategy | lekking behaviour | randomization test | song alternation | song overlap,6,0,,9169-12,"Department of Biology, University of New Mexico"

Since European settlement, over 50 % of coastal wetlands have been lost in the Laurentian Great Lakes basin, causing growing concern and increased monitoring by government agencies. For over a decade, monitoring efforts have focused on the development of regional and organism-specific measures. To facilitate collaboration and information sharing between public, private, and government agencies throughout the Great Lakes basin, we developed standardized methods and indicators used for assessing wetland condition. Using an ecosystem approach and a stratified random site selection process, birds, anurans, fish, macroinvertebrates, vegetation, and physico-chemical conditions were sampled in coastal wetlands of all five Great Lakes including sites from the United States and Canada.

A total of 470 fillets of 18 fish species collected from various parts of the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes between 2006 and 2013 were analyzed for 17 (expanded to 33 in 2009) PBDEs. For a limited number of species, fillet to whole body and fillet to eggs PBDEs were compared to examine pattern and concentration among tissue types. Levels and patterns of PBDEs varied dramatically within and among the 18 fish species. Bottom dwelling Common Carp (and White Sucker) exhibited the highest ∑ PBDE levels (27–71 ng/g). Lake Trout and Lake Whitefish from Lake Superior had higher levels than those from the other Great Lakes; otherwise the spatial trend was Lake Ontario ≫ Erie ~ Huron ~ Superior. The measured levels would result in restriction on consumption of only Common Carp from the Toronto waterfront area, which is in proximity to the most urbanised region on the Canadian side of the basin. Deca-BDE was the major congener in panfish, while BDE-47 was the major congener in top predators and its contribution to ∑ PBDE increased with the contamination. Although ∑ PBDE was related to fish length and lipid content when all measurements were pooled, the relationships were variable for individual sampling events (species/location/year). Whole body ∑ PBDE for bottom dweller Brown Bullhead and Common Carp were 2.6–4.9 times greater and egg ∑ PBDE for four fatty Salmon/Trout species were same to 6.5 times greater than the corresponding fillet concentrations. Levels of major lower brominated PBDEs appear to have declined in fish fillets by 46–74% between 2006/07 and 2012. Although PBDE in existing consumer items will remain in-use for a while, it will likely not result in appreciable accumulation of PBDEs in fish. Based on an overall assessment, regular monitoring of PBDEs in Great Lake fish can be replaced with targeted surveillance and focus can be shifted to other in-use flame retardants.",Brominated flame retardants | Fish consumption advisories | Great Lakes | Spatial and temporal trends,18,0,,undefined,

All rights reserved. Wild and captive vertebrates face multiple stressors that all have the potential to induce chronic maternal stress (i.e., sustained, elevated plasma glucocorticoids), resulting in embryo exposure to elevated maternally derived glucocorticoids. In oviparous taxa such as fish, maternally derived glucocorticoids in eggs are known for their capacity to shape offspring phenotype. Using a variety of methodologies, scientists have quantified maternally derived levels of egg cortisol, the primary glucocorticoid in fishes, and examined the cascading effects of egg cortisol on progeny phenotype. Here we summarize and interpret the current state of knowledge on egg cortisol in fishes and the relationships linking maternal stress/state to egg cortisol and offspring phenotype/fitness. Considerable variation in levels of egg cortisol exists across species and among females within a species; this variation is hypothesized to be due to interspecific differences in reproductive life history and intraspecific differences in female condition. Outcomes of experimental studies manipulating egg cortisol vary both inter- and intraspecifically. Moreover, while exogenous elevation of egg cortisol (as a proxy for maternal stress) induces phenotypic changes commonly considered to be maladaptive (e.g., smaller offspring size), emerging work in other taxa suggests that there can be positive effects on fitness when the offspring’s environment is taken into account. Investigations into (i) mechanisms by which egg cortisol elicits phenotypic change in offspring (e.g., epigenetics), (ii) maternal and offspring buffering capacity of cortisol, and (iii) factors driving natural variation in egg cortisol and how this variation affects offspring phenotype and fitness are all germane to discussions on egg glucocorticoids as signals of maternal stress.",Cortisol | Intergenerational effects | Match/mismatch | Maternal stress | Oocyte | Phenotype,15,0,,undefined,Canada Research Chairs

We assessed maximum trihalomethane production from one chlorine dose for three types of ballast water (fresh, brackish and marine) and three levels of total organic carbon (TOC) concentration (natural, filtered, enhanced). While the current standard test considers a 5 day voyage, there is a high possibility of shorter trips and sudden change of plans that will release treated waters in the environment.

Perceptual models of animal vision have greatly contributed to our understanding of animalanimal and plant-animal communication. The receptor-noise model of color contrasts has been central to this research as it quantifies the difference between two colors for any visual system of interest. However, if the properties of the visual system are unknown, assumptions regarding parameter values must be made, generally with unknown consequences. In this study, we conduct a sensitivity analysis of the receptor-noise model using avian visual system parameters to systematically investigate the influence of variation in light environment, photoreceptor sensitivities, photoreceptor densities, and light transmission properties of the ocular media and the oil droplets. We calculated the chromatic contrast of 15 plumage patches to quantify a dichromatism score for 70 species of Galliformes, a group of birds that display a wide range of sexual dimorphism. We found that the photoreceptor densities and the wavelength of maximum sensitivity of the short-wavelength-sensitive photoreceptor 1 (SWS1) can change dichromatism scores by 50% to 100%. In contrast, the light environment, transmission properties of the oil droplets, transmission properties of the ocular media, and the peak sensitivities of the cone photoreceptors had a smaller impact on the scores. By investigating the effect of varying two or more parameters simultaneously, we further demonstrate that improper parameterization could lead to differences between calculated and actual contrasts of more than 650%. Our findings demonstrate that improper parameterization of tetrachromatic visual models can have very large effects on measures of dichromatism scores, potentially leading to erroneous inferences. We urge more complete characterization of avian retinal properties and recommend that researchers either determine whether their species of interest possess an ultraviolet or near-ultraviolet sensitive SWS1 photoreceptor, or present models for both.",,9,1,,undefined,Field Museum

Zooplankton were characterized by higher proportions of less chlorinated and hydrophobic homologs relative to zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha), mayfly (Hexagenia limbata) and emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides) samples. PCB biota-sediment accumulation factors (BSAF) differed significantly among species with zebra mussels and emerald shiners having the highest BSAFs. Principal components analysis of sample PCB profiles reflected the contrasting pelagic and benthic habitats occupied by filter-feeding zooplankton and zebra mussel samples. Benthic mayfly PCB profiles were characterized by increasingly hydrophobic (logKOW ≥ 6.9) congeners with more variable emerald shiner profiles reflecting the greater mobility and extent of spatial habitat integration achieved by this secondary consumer.

There are significant conservation benefits to studying the stress response of commercially important fish species. Particularly in the Arctic ecosystem, where reducing ice extent has resulted in heightened interest in developing commercial fisheries, there is a need to better understand how fish respond to capture stressors. To that end, blood lactate and glucose of Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides and Greenland shark Somniosus microcephalus were assessed after capture from fishing gear to evaluate factors that might influence physiological disturbance. Greenland halibut lactate values had a mean of 1.0 ± 0.7 mmol/L and showed a positive relationship with time since capture. Blood glucose concentrations for Greenland halibut had a mean of 1.8 ± 0.6 mmol/L and were positively related to both time since capture and fork length. Greenland shark lactate values varied depending on depth, with individuals captured at 300–600 m displaying significantly lower concentrations (1.6 ± 0.5 mmol/L) than those caught at depths between 600 and 700 m (6.4 ± 2.4 mmol/L) and 700–900 m (3.7 ± 1.2 mmol/L). Glucose values for the Greenland shark had a mean of 4.9 ± 1.5 mmol/L and were positively correlated with body length. Relative to temperate fish species, the metabolite concentrations are low but the inherent challenges with deep-water fish makes it difficult to obtain baseline (pre-stress) values to quantify the magnitude of stress response.

Point counts are widely used for conducting ecological surveys of wild birds. Vocal output of birds varies with time of day, and therefore the results of ecological surveys should also vary with time of day. We modeled how males' singing rates change over the morning. We calculated song rates in 3 min sampling periods (the standard sampling period used by the north American breeding bird Survey) and compared how detection rates vary as sampling period increases. We recorded singing activity in 15 neighbourhoods of breeding black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) with 16-element microphone arrays that recorded every song from every male in every neighbourhood. We calculated the proportion of males that produced one or more songs during 3, 5, and 10 min count periods between nautical twilight and late morning. our results show a strong peak in singing activity just before sunrise followed by a steady decline in singing activity over the course of the morning. We found that longer sampling periods yielded significantly higher detection rates at all times after sunrise. After sunrise, detection rates never exceeded 60%, even with 10 min sampling periods. We found that unpaired males had significantly higher detection rates than paired males but we found no difference between paired males with fertile versus incubating mates. our results provide strong evidence that, for black-capped Chickadees, surveys during the dawn chorus provide the most comprehensive assessment of the number of birds present, and that longer sampling periods yield significantly better estimates of population sizes at all times after sunrise.",Acoustic location system | Black-capped Chickadee | Dawn song | Detection rate | Point count,1,1,,undefined,Society of Canadian Ornithologists

Here, we compare tissue concentrations of total mercury (THg) and legacy and emerging persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in native versus invading forage species sampled from 2012 to 2014 near Arviat, Clyde River, and Resolute Bay, NU, representing, low, mid- and high eastern Canadian Arctic regions, respectively. Concentrations of THg, legacy Σ-polychlorinated biphenyls (ΣPCB) and Σ-organochlorine (ΣOC) pesticides were detected in all forage species, whereas emerging halogenated flame retardants were detected in only a few individuals. Concentrations of major contaminant groups among regions did not vary for Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida), while for sculpin (Cottoidea) there was no clear latitudinal trend. Thus, considering interspecific variation, native sculpin and northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) had the highest overall concentrations of THg (0.17 ± 0.02 and 0.21 ± 0.01 μg g−1 wet weight, respectively), ΣPCB (322 ± 35 and 245 ± 25 ng g−1 lipid weight (lw), respectively), and ΣOC (413 ± 38 and 734 ± 64 ng g−1 lw, respectively). Comparing the keystone native species, Arctic cod, to its ‘replacement’ species, capelin (Mallotus villosus) and sandlance (Ammodytes spp.), THg concentrations were higher in Arctic cod compared to capelin (p < 0.001), which was partly explained by differences in fish length. Conversely, capelin and sandlance had higher concentrations of most POPs than Arctic cod (p < 0.02). Neither feeding habitat (based on δ13C), trophic position (based on δ15N), nor fish length significantly explained these differences in POPs between Arctic cod, capelin and sandlance. Higher POPs concentrations, as well as variation in congener/compound patterns, in capelin and sandlance relative to Arctic cod seem, therefore, more likely related to a more “temperate”-type contaminant signature in the invaders. Nevertheless, the relatively small (up to two-fold) magnitude of these differences suggested limited effects of these ecological changes on contaminant uptake by Arctic piscivores.",Arctic | Climate change | Invasion | Mercury | Organic contaminants,5,0,,undefined,

Understanding their movements and distribution is important for predicting future trends in response to climate change. It was commonly assumed that Arctic cod move horizontally throughout the Arctic, but this was so far unproven. In July 2012, 85 Arctic cod were implanted with acoustic transmitters at Resolute Bay, Nunavut, Canada. Five (5.9%) were subsequently detected ∼192 km due east along the Barrow Strait, between 67 and 215 days after last detection in Resolute Bay (mean ± SE = 161.4 ± 26.7 days). Minimum transition rates ranged between 0.89 and 2.87 km·day−1 (mean ± SE = 1.4 ± 0.4 km·day−1). A combination of factors, most notably sea ice extent, make it highly improbable that the detections were representative of predated or scavenged Arctic cod. This represents the first confirmed account of large-scale horizontal movements by this or any Arctic forage fish species. With continuing miniaturization of acoustic telemetry tags, increasing battery life, and expanded receiver coverage, it will be possible to gain a more comprehensive understanding of Arctic cod movements.",,3,0,,undefined,Environment Canada

Environmental variation influences resource distribution, thereby affecting animal movement and foraging decisions. Climate change is altering environmental processes worldwide, but particularly in the Arctic, where changes in the phenology of sea ice have been redistributing resources across space and time. How polar marine predators such as ringed seals Pusa hispida hispida, whose ecology is tightly tied to sea ice, respond to different sea ice dynamics across large spatial scales is generally unknown. Here, behavioural states (resident and traveling) were estimated using state-space models on adult (n = 45) and subadult (n = 85) ringed seal satellite telemetry tracks from 6 Arctic locations. Tagged ringed seals spanned a wide latitudinal (56.54° to 75.58° N) and sea ice phenological range from short (1 to 2 mo) to longer (6 mo) ice-free periods. We assessed the influences of age class and several intra-and inter-annual environmental variables on ringed seal movement ecology. Both adults and subadults spent most of the icefree season in a resident state (93 and 77%, respectively). A latitudinal gradient was characterised, where longer ice-free seasons and less inter-annual variability in sea ice phenology at lower latitudes were related to ringed seals spending more time in a resident state than their conspecifics at higher latitudes (90 versus 58%, respectively), where the ice-free season was shorter and sea ice phenology between years was less synchronous. Ringed seals are responding to latitudinal differences in sea ice phenology which affect prey distribution, suggesting plasticity in their foraging decisions and spatiotemporal differences in prey distribution across the rapidly changing Arctic.",Animal movement | Arctic | Climate change | Foraging behaviour | Marine mammal | Spatial ecology,8,1,,undefined,

Frogs and toads exhibit complex vocal behavior, often in the context of mating and resource defense. Although over 6,500 species of frogs and toads have been described, detailed accounts of vocal behavior exist for very few species. In this study, we provide the first detailed investigation of the vocal behavior of Neotropical Yellow Toads, Incilius luetkenii, based on recordings collected from animals in northwestern Costa Rica. We provide quantitative measurements of two call types, we test the hypothesis that male body size is related to the structure of male calls, we investigate the context in which males produce calls, and we discuss the importance of their vocal behavior in the framework of an aggressive scramble competition mating system. We found that male I. luetkenii produce two vocalizations during their explosive breeding aggregations: advertisement calls and release calls. Advertisement calls are 2.5 sec-long vocalizations consisting of a series of pulses. Release calls are 0.6 sec-long vocalizations consisting of a small number of pulses and produced when other males attempt amplexus on them. As predicted, spectral properties of advertisement calls were inversely related to body size. Video analysis of male calling behavior revealed a call rate of 0.58 calls per minute and revealed that most advertisement calls occur within 2 sec following a contact with another male. Our findings suggest that advertisement calls and, by extension, chorusing behavior are associated with aggression between males during mating aggregations and that males may communicate acoustic information about their body size during male-male encounters.",,1,0,,-13-16,Government of Ontario

Prenatal exposure to elevated glucocorticoids can act as a signal of environmental stress, resulting in modifications to offspring phenotype. While “negative” phenotypic effects (i.e., smaller size, slower growth) are often reported, recent research coupling phenotype with other fitness-related traits has suggested positive impacts of prenatal stress. Using captive Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), we treated eggs with biologically relevant cortisol levels—low (300 ng mL−1), high (1,000 ng mL−1), or control (0 ng mL−1)—to examine the early-life impacts of maternally transferred stress hormones on offspring. Specifically, we measured early survival, rate of development, and multiple measures of morphology. Low and high cortisol dosing of eggs resulted in significantly higher survival compared to controls (37% and 24% higher, respectively). Fish reared from high dose eggs were structurally smaller compared to control fish, but despite this variation in structural size, exposure to elevated cortisol did not impact developmental rate. These results demonstrate that elevations in egg cortisol can positively influence offspring fitness through an increase in early survival while also altering phenotype at a critical life-history stage. Overall, these results suggest that exposure to prenatal stress may not always produce apparently negative impacts on offspring fitness and further proposes that complex phenotypic responses should be examined in relevant environmental conditions.",,3,0,,undefined,Pan-Massachusetts Challenge

The application of physiological measures to conservation monitoring has been gaining momentum and, while a suite of physiological traits are available to ascertain disturbance and condition in wildlife populations, glucocorticoids (i.e., GCs; cortisol and corticosterone) are the most heavily employed. The interpretation of GC levels as sensitive indicators of population change necessitates that GCs and metrics of population persistence are linked. However, the relationship between GCs and fitness may be highly context-dependent, changing direction, or significance, depending on the GC measure, fitness metric, life history stage, or other intrinsic and extrinsic contexts considered. We examined the relationship between baseline plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels measured at two periods of the breeding season and three metrics of fitness (offspring quality, reproductive output, and adult survival) in female Tree Swallows (Tachycineta bicolor). Specifically, we investigated whether (1) a relationship between baseline CORT metrics and fitness exists in our population, (2) whether the inclusion of energetic contexts, such as food availability, reproductive investment, or body mass, could alter or improve the strength of the relationship between CORT and fitness, and (3) whether energetic contexts could better predict fitness compared to CORT metrics. Importantly, we investigated these relationships in both natural conditions and under an experimental manipulation of foraging profitability (feather clipping) to determine the influence of an environmental constraint on GC-fitness relationships. We found a lack of relationship between baseline CORT and both short- and long-term metrics of fitness in control and clipped birds. In contrast, loss in body mass over reproduction positively predicted reproductive output (number of chicks leaving the nest) in control birds; however, the relationship was characterized by a low R2 (5%), limiting the predictive capacity, and therefore the application potential, of such a measure in a conservation setting. Our results stress the importance of ground-truthing GC-fitness relationships and indicate that baseline GCs will likely not be easily employed as conservation biomarkers across some species and life history stages. Given the accumulating evidence of temporally dynamic, inconsistent, and context-dependent GC-fitness relationships, placing effort towards directly measuring fitness traits, rather than plasma GC levels, will likely be more worthwhile for many conservation endeavours.",baseline | biomarker | conservation physiology | CORT-fitness | corticosterone | fitness | flexibility | glucocorticoid | reproductive success | survival | Tachycineta bicolor,4,0,,29401,Canada Foundation for Innovation

However, since most investigations have been unable to examine habitat variability, GC levels, and fitness simultaneously, such interpretations remain largely unvalidated. We combined a quantification of two habitat types, a manipulation of foraging ability (feather-clipping just prior to nestling rearing), multiple baseline plasma GC measures, and multi-year reproductive monitoring to experimentally examine the linkages between habitat quality, GCs, and fitness in female tree swallows Tachycineta bicolor. Control females experiencing the higher early-season food resources of inland–pasture habitat laid larger clutches, but fledged an equal number but lower mass offspring compared to those in riparian–cropland habitat. Despite these differences in reproductive success, females nesting in the two habitat types did not differ in baseline GC levels at the early- or late-breeding stage. Feather-clipping reduced provisioning rate in both habitat types. However, baseline GC levels were affected in a habitat-specific way; only individuals in inland–pasture habitats showed an increase in GCs. Despite this difference in GC levels, the manipulation did not influence offspring mass, reproductive output, adult return rate (a proxy for survival) to the following year, or reproductive success in the subsequent year. Nonetheless, regardless of treatment, individuals with higher GC levels during the late breeding stage returned in the following year with higher GC levels at incubation, indicating a long-term effect on future GC levels. Our results indicate that environmental changes (e.g. foraging conditions) can have consequences for body condition, behaviour, and current and future baseline GC levels without concomitant influences on fitness, and that differences in fitness components between habitats may not be reflected in baseline GC levels. These results illustrate that baseline GCs may not simultaneously reflect environmental quality and fitness, potentially limiting their application in ecological and conservation settings.",,15,0,,CA 0266,Canada Foundation for Innovation

Human-mediated vectors often inadvertently translocate species assemblages to new environments. Examining the dynamics of entrained species assemblages during transport can provide insights into the introduction risk associated with these vectors. Ship biofouling is a major transport vector of nonindigenous species in coastal ecosystems globally, yet its magnitude in the Arctic is poorly understood. To determine whether biofouling organisms on ships can survive passages in Arctic waters, we examined how biofouling assemblage structure changed before, during, and after eight round-trip military voyages from temperate to Arctic ports in Canada. Species richness first decreased (~70% loss) and then recovered (~27% loss compared to the original assemblages), as ships travelled to and from the Arctic, respectively, whereas total abundance typically declined over time (~55% total loss). Biofouling community structure differed significantly before and during Arctic transits as well as between those sampled during and after voyages. Assemblage structure varied across different parts of the hull; however, temporal changes were independent of hull location, suggesting that niche areas did not provide protection for biofouling organisms against adverse conditions in the Arctic. Biofouling algae appear to be more tolerant of transport conditions during Arctic voyages than are mobile, sessile, and sedentary invertebrates. Our results suggest that biofouling assemblages on ships generally have poor survivorship during Arctic voyages. Nonetheless, some potential for transporting nonindigenous species to the Arctic via ship biofouling remains, as at least six taxa new to the Canadian Arctic, including a nonindigenous cirripede, appeared to have survived transits from temperate to Arctic ports.",,8,1,,undefined,

In most teleost fish species, sperm competition is a key factor in determining male reproductive success, leading to selection on males to increase their reproductive investment in gonads and ejaculate competitiveness. In this study, reproductive investment patterns were assayed by examining the relative investment in gonads and sperm quality metrics (in river water and in the presence of ovarian fluid) of masu salmon, Oncorhynchus masou, representing two fixed male alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs; small sneaking parr males and large dominant anadromous males). Although anadromous males were significantly larger in body size compared to parr males, the latter invested significantly more in relative gonad mass than the former. Sperm velocity and motility were significantly higher, and longevity was significantly lower in parr males than in anadromous males in river water. However, no difference in any of these sperm quality metrics was detected between the ARTs in the presence of ovarian fluid. Sperm velocity and motility were not affected by the presence of ovarian fluid compared to river water for parr males, but both traits increased significantly for anadromous males in ovarian fluid relative to river water, whereas longevity significantly increased in the presence of ovarian fluid compared to river water for both ARTs. We interpret these findings in light of potential cryptic female choice mechanisms and the sneak-guard model of sperm competition that is based on differences in sperm competition risk and alternative investment possibilities among ARTs.",External fertilization | Gonadosomatic index | Postcopulatory | Sperm competition,6,0,,15K07229,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science

With 20% recoverable through open pit mining methods, this extraction process produces a considerable amount of fluid fine tailings (FFT) waste material, which must be deposited on site in tailings ponds. These ponds allow the waste sand, clay and residual bitumen to settle out of the water column, allowing for the water to be recycled for use again in the extraction process. It is vital to gain a better understanding of the processes contributing to the development of physicochemical gradients (pH, Eh, Oxygen etc…) that form in these tailings ponds over time, with the goal of remediation and subsequent construction of end-pit lake systems once oil extraction has ceased. To differentiate between the impacts of biotic and abiotic processes in fresh (newly processed material) and mature FFT (∼38 year old tailings) over a 52-week study, a specific experimental design was utilized in accordance with novel microsensor profiling techniques. The sulfide diffusive fluxes within mature biotic systems measured 37.6 μmol m−2 day−1 at the onset of the experiment, decreasing over time, as FeS mineralization progressed. In addition, DO fluxes also showed strong correlation to the physical affects of consolidation, and overall biological consumption of O2 at the FFT-water interface.

A minimum threshold body mass is required to initiate reproduction, and the timing of reaching this threshold is critical because of the trade-off between delaying breeding to gain in condition against the declining value of offspring with later reproductive timing. Long-lived species have the flexibility within their life history to skip reproduction in a given year if they are unable to achieve this theoretical mass threshold. Although the decision to breed or not is an important parameter influencing population dynamics, the mechanisms underlying this decision are poorly understood. Here, we mimicked an unpredictable environmental perturbation that induced a reduction in body mass of Arctic pre-breeding (before the laying period) female common eiders Somateria mollissima; a long-lived migratory seaduck, while controlling for individual variation in the pre-laying physiological reproductive readiness via vitellogenin (VTG) – a yolk-targeted lipoprotein. Our aim was to causally determine the interaction between body condition and pre-laying reproductive readiness (VTG) on breeding propensity by experimentally reducing body mass in treatment females. We first demonstrated that arrival body condition was a key driver of breeding propensity. Secondly, we found that treatment and VTG levels interacted to influence breeding propensity, indicating that our experimental manipulation, mimicking an unpredictable food shortage, reduced breeding propensity, regardless of the degree of pre-laying physiological reproductive readiness (i.e. timing of ovarian follicles recruitment). Our experiment demonstrates that momentary environmental perturbations during the pre-breeding period can strongly affect the decision to breed, a key parameter driving population dynamics.",,4,0,,undefined,

To maximize reproductive success, males have to adaptively tailor their sperm expenditure in relation to the quality of potential mates because they require time to replenish their sperm supply for subsequent mating opportunities. Therefore, in mating contexts where males must choose among females in a short period of time, as is the case with semelparous species (which die after one intensely competitive short duration breeding season), selection on sperm allocation can be expected to be a powerful selective agent that shapes the male reproductive success. We quantitatively investigated sperm allocation patterns in chum salmon in relation to perceived female quality by developing a novel method for determining the amount of sperm allocated per ejaculate during spawning bouts. We examined the relationship between sperm expenditure and the body size of paired females (a proxy of egg number and egg quality) in the absence of male–male competition in an experimental channel. The estimated amount of sperm released per spawning event was positively correlated with the size of paired females. However, the number of spawning events a female participated in, which reduces the number of eggs she spawns in each subsequent bout, did not affect this relationship. These results provide support for predictions arising from the sperm allocation hypothesis, male salmon do economize their sperm expenditure in accordance with paired female body size as predicted for their first spawning event, but males overestimate or are unable to assess the quality of females beyond size and provide more sperm than they should in theory when paired with a female that spawned previously. Overall, the observed sperm allocation pattern in chum salmon appears to be adapted to maximize reproductive success assuming female size is an honest indicator of quality, although temporal changes in a female’s quality during a reproductive season should be considered when examining sperm allocation strategies.",Acceleration data loggers | Female body size | Mate choice | Spawning behaviour,2,1,,undefined,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science

Over an eight-year period, we documented 27 commercial vessel-trips in which ballast water was loaded in colonized sites and later discharged untreated into Pacific coast ports in the USA. California had the highest number of discharges including San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles-Long Beach. A species distribution model suggests that the probability of lionfish establishment is low for the western USA, Colombia and Panama, low to medium for Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala, medium to high for mainland Ecuador, and very high for western Mexico, Peru and the Galapagos Islands. Given the species' intolerance of freshwater conditions, we propose that ballast water exchange be conducted in Gatún Lake, Panama for western-bound vessels carrying 'risky' ballast water to prevent invasion of the eastern Pacific Ocean.This is an open access article, free of all copyright, and may be freely reproduced, distributed, transmitted, modified, built upon, or otherwise used by anyone for any lawful purpose.

Numerous behavioral paradigms have been developed to assess tinnitus-like behavior in animals. Nevertheless, they are often limited by prolonged training requirements, as well as an inability to simultaneously assess onset and lasting tinnitus behavior, tinnitus pitch or duration, or tinnitus presence without grouping data from multiple animals or testing sessions. To enhance behavioral testing of tinnitus, we developed a conditioned licking suppression paradigm to determine the pitch(s) of both onset and lasting tinnitus-like behavior within individual animals. Rats learned to lick water during broadband or narrowband noises, and to suppress licking to avoid footshocks during silence. After noise exposure, rats significantly increased licking during silent trials, suggesting onset tinnitus-like behavior. Lasting tinnitus-behavior, however, was exhibited in about half of noise-exposed rats through 7 weeks post-exposure tested. Licking activity during narrowband sound trials remained unchanged following noise exposure, while ABR hearing thresholds fully recovered and were comparable between tinnitus(+) and tinnitus(-) rats. To assess another tinnitus inducer, rats were injected with sodium salicylate. They demonstrated high pitch tinnitus-like behavior, but later recovered by 5 days post-injection. Further control studies showed that 1): sham noise-exposed rats tested with footshock did not exhibit tinnitus-like behavior, and 2): noise-exposed or sham rats tested without footshocks showed no fundamental changes in behavior compared to those tested with shocks. Together, these results demonstrate that this paradigm can efficiently test the development of noise- and salicylate-induced tinnitus behavior. The ability to assess tinnitus individually, over time, and without averaging data enables us to realistically address tinnitus in a clinically relevant way. Thus, we believe that this optimized behavioral paradigm will facilitate investigations into the mechanisms of tinnitus and development of effective treatments.",,3,1,,undefined,

Accurate predictions on the bioaccumulation of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are critical for hazard and ecosystem health assessments. Aquatic systems are influenced by multiple stressors including climate change and species invasions and it is important to be able to predict variability in POP concentrations in changing environments. Current steady state bioaccumulation models simplify POP bioaccumulation dynamics, assuming that pollutant uptake and elimination processes become balanced over an organism's lifespan. These models do not consider the complexity of dynamic variables such as temperature and growth rates which are known to have the potential to regulate bioaccumulation in aquatic organisms. We contrast a steady state (SS) bioaccumulation model with a dynamic nonsteady state (NSS) model and a no elimination (NE) model. We demonstrate that both the NSS and the NE models are superior at predicting both average concentrations as well as variation in POPs among individuals. This comparison demonstrates that temporal drivers, such as environmental fluctuations in temperature, growth dynamics, and modified food-web structure strongly determine contaminant concentrations and variability in a changing environment. These results support the recommendation of the future development of more dynamic, nonsteady state bioaccumulation models to predict hazard and risk assessments in the Anthropocene.",,7,0,,undefined,

The use and importance of reintroduction as a conservation tool to return a species to its historical range from which it has been extirpated will increase as climate change and human development accelerate habitat loss and population extinctions. Although the number of reintroduction attempts has increased rapidly over the past 2 decades, the success rate is generally low. As a result of population differences in fitness-related traits and divergent responses to environmental stresses, population performance upon reintroduction is highly variable, and it is generally agreed that selecting an appropriate source population is a critical component of a successful reintroduction. Conservation genomics is an emerging field that addresses long-standing challenges in conservation, and the potential for using novel molecular genetic approaches to inform and improve conservation efforts is high. Because the successful establishment and persistence of reintroduced populations is highly dependent on the functional genetic variation and environmental stress tolerance of the source population, we propose the application of conservation genomics and transcriptomics to guide reintroduction practices. Specifically, we propose using genome-wide functional loci to estimate genetic variation of source populations. This estimate can then be used to predict the potential for adaptation. We also propose using transcriptional profiling to measure the expression response of fitness-related genes to environmental stresses as a proxy for acclimation (tolerance) capacity. Appropriate application of conservation genomics and transcriptomics has the potential to dramatically enhance reintroduction success in a time of rapidly declining biodiversity and accelerating environmental change.",acclimation | aclimatación | adaptación | adaptation | biología de la reintroducción | conservation genomics | diversidad genética | estrés | genetic diversity | genómica de la conservación | reintroduction biology | SNP | stress,22,0,,undefined,

The ability to detect non-indigenous species (NIS), particularly those present at low abundance, is limited by difficulties in performing exhaustive sampling and in identifying species. Here we sample zooplankton from 16 major Canadian ports and apply a metabarcoding approach to detect NIS. Location: Marine and freshwater ports along Canadian coastlines (Pacific, Arctic, Atlantic) and the Great Lakes. Methods: We amplified the V4 region of the small subunit ribosomal DNA (18S) and used two distinct analytic protocols to identify species present at low abundance. Taxonomic assignment was conducted using BLAST searches against a local 18S sequence database of either (i) individual reads (totalling 7,733,541 reads) or (ii) operational taxonomic units (OTUs) generated by sequence clustering. Phylogenetic analyses were performed to confirm the identity of reads with ambiguous taxonomic assignment. Results: Taxonomic assignment of individual reads identified 379 zooplankton species at a minimum sequence identity of 97%. Of these, 24 species were identified as NIS, 11 of which were detected in previously unreported locations. When reads were clustered into OTUs prior to taxonomic assignment, six NIS were no longer detected and an additional NIS was falsely identified. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that sequences belonging to closely related species clustered together into shared OTUs as a result of low interspecific variation. NIS can thus be misidentified when their sequences join the OTUs of more abundant native species. Main conclusions: Our results reveal the power of the metabarcoding approach, whilst also highlighting the need to account for potentially low levels of genetic diversity when processing data, to use barcode markers that allow differentiation of closely related species and to continue building comprehensive sequence databases that allow reliable and fine-scale taxonomic designation.",18S | biodiversity | biomonitoring | high-throughput sequencing | invasive species | metabarcoding | operational taxonomic unit,19,0,,100-talent,Canada Research Chairs

Although this test was designed for fishes that swim in the water column, it has been applied to fishes that adhere to the substrate. Here we examined the extent to which substrate holding, slipping and swimming contributed to reaching Ucrit in an example substrate holding fish, the invasive round goby. A linear model indicated that each behavior contributed significantly to Ucrit, but that substrate holding was by far the biggest contributor (65.8 ± 3.9 % vs. 5.8 ± 0.9 and 28.4 ± 3.4 % slipping and swimming).

The influence of variation in individual state on key reproductive decisions impacting fitness is well appreciated in evolutionary ecology. Rowe et al. (1994) developed a condition-dependent individual optimization model predicting that three key factors impact the ability of migratory female birds to individually optimize breeding phenology tomaximize fitness in seasonal environments: arrival condition, arrival date, and ability to gain in condition on the breeding grounds. While empirical studies have confirmed that greater arrival body mass and earlier arrival dates result in earlier laying, no study has assessed whether individual variation in energetic management of condition gain effects this key fitness-related decision. Using an 8-year data set from over 350 prebreeding female Arctic common eiders (Somateria mollissima), we tested this component of the model by examining whether individual variation in two physiological traits influencing energetic management (plasma triglycerides: physiological fattening rate; baseline corticosterone: energetic demand) predicted individual variation in breeding phenology after controlling for arrival date and body mass. As predicted by the optimization model, individuals with higher fattening rates and lower energetic demand had the earliest breeding phenology (shortest delays between arrival and laying; earliest laying dates). Our results are the first to empirically determine that individual flexibility in prebreeding energetic management influences key fitness-related reproductive decisions, suggesting that individuals have the capacity to optimally manage reproductive investment.",Breeding phenology | Energetic management | Fattening rate | Glucocorticoids | Individual optimization | Triglycerides,10,0,,undefined,

Because D. hesperus is an omnivore, the structure of the plant community and the nutritional value of the plants in the release habitat are likely to affect its establishment and population growth. Fifteen adult D. hesperus (ten females, five males) were placed into arenas that contained a tomato plant (Solanum lycopersicum L., Solanales: Solanaceae) of either high or low leaf nitrogen content and one of three alternative host plants: mullein (Verbascum thapsus L., Lamiales: Scrophulariaceae), pepper (Capiscum annuum L., Solanales: Solanaceae), or eggplant (Solanum melongena L., Solanales: Solanaceae). Adults remained in the enclosures for seven days; following their removal, F1 generation nymphs, and subsequently, F1 adults were counted as they emerged and the percent change in population size between generations was calculated. Nymph emergence was affected by the alternative host plant, such that emergence was greatest in arenas with mullein. Tomato nitrogen content only affected nymph emergence in arenas with mullein; more nymphs emerged when low nitrogen tomato was present. The presence of mullein also resulted in larger F1 adult numbers and a greater change in population size between generations compared to eggplant and pepper.

Inbreeding depression is the loss of fitness resulting from the mating of genetically related individuals. Traditionally, the study of inbreeding depression focused on genetic effects, although recent research has identified DNA methylation as also having a role in inbreeding effects. Since inbreeding depression and DNA methylation change with age and environmental stress, DNA methylation is a likely candidate for the regulation of genes associated with inbreeding depression. Here, we use a targeted, multigene approach to assess methylation at 22 growth-, metabolic-, immune- and stress-related genes. We developed PCR-based DNA methylation assays to test the effects of intense inbreeding on intragenic gene-specific methylation in inbred and outbred Chinook salmon. Inbred fish had altered methylation at three genes, CK-1, GTIIBS and hsp70, suggesting that methylation changes associated with inbreeding depression are targeted to specific genes and are not whole-genome effects. While we did not find a significant inbreeding by age interaction, we found that DNA methylation generally increases with age, although methylation decreased with age in five genes, CK-1, IFN-ɣ, HNRNPL, hsc71 and FSHb, potentially due to environmental context and sexual maturation. As expected, we found methylation patterns differed among tissue types, highlighting the need for careful selection of target tissue for methylation studies. This study provides insight into the role of epigenetic effects on ageing, environmental response and tissue function in Chinook salmon and shows that methylation is a targeted and regulated cellular process. We provide the first evidence of epigenetically based inbreeding depression in vertebrates.",ageing | DNA methylation | environmental stress | genetic stress | inbreeding | inbreeding depression,10,0,,814014,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Molecular studies in Arabidopsis have shown that auxin perception and signaling is mediated via TIR1/AFB–Aux/IAA co-receptors that assemble as part of the SCFTIR1/AFB E3 ubiquitin-ligase complex and direct the auxin-regulated degradation of Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors. Despite the importance of auxin signaling, little is known about the functional regulation of the TIR1/AFB receptor family. Here we show that TIR1 can oligomerize in planta via a set of spatially clustered amino acid residues. While none of the residues identified reside in the interaction interface of the TIR1-Aux/IAA degron, they nonetheless regulate the binding of TIR1 to Aux/IAA substrate proteins and their subsequent degradation in vivo as an essential aspect of auxin signaling. We propose oligomerization of TIR1 as a novel regulatory mechanism in the regulation of auxin-mediated plant patterning and development.",,11,1,,undefined,

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Successful biological invasion requires introduction of a viable population of a nonindigenous species (NIS). Rarely have ecologists assessed changes in populations while entrained in invasion pathways. Here, we investigate how zooplankton communities resident in ballast water change during transoceanic voyages. We used next-generation sequencing technology to sequence a nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA fragment of zooplankton from ballast water during initial, middle, and final segments as a vessel transited between Canada and Brazil. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) diversity decreased as voyage duration increased, indicating loss of community-based genetic diversity and development of bottlenecks for zooplankton taxa prior to discharge of ballast water. On average, we observed 47, 26, and 24 OTUs in initial, middle, and final samples, respectively. Moreover, a comparison of genetic diversity within taxa indicated likely attenuation of OTUs in final relative to initial samples. Abundance of the most common taxa (copepods) declined in all final relative to initial samples. Some taxa (e.g., Copepoda) were represented by a high number of OTUs throughout the voyage, and thus had a high level of intraspecific genetic variation. It is not clear whether genotypes that were most successful in surviving transit in ballast water will be the most successful upon introduction to novel environments. This study highlights that population bottlenecks may be common prior to introduction of NIS to new ecosystems.",ballast water | biological invasion | genetic diversity | invasive species | Ion torrent PGM | next-generation sequencing | nonindigenous species | zooplankton,6,1,,SG,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Levels and distribution of PFAAs in water, sediment and fish samples collected from the area varied widely. An upstream pond beside a former firefighting training area (FFTA) was confirmed as the source of PFAAs even 20 years after the last use of the foam at the FFTA. Recent PFOS concentration in water (~ 60 ng/L) at Lake Niapenco, about 14 km downstream of the pond, was still 3–7 × higher than the background levels. For PFOS, Log KD ranged 1.3–2.5 (mean ± SE: 1.7 ± 0.1), Log BAFs ranged 2.4–4.7 (3.4 ± 0.05), and Log BSAFs ranged 0.7–2.9 (1.7 ± 0.05).

A fish consumption based water guideline was estimated at 1–15 ng/L, which is likely applicable worldwide given that the Log BAFs observed in this study were comparable to those previously reported in the literature.

Consistent differences in δ15N values occurred between dermis and muscle tissue for both species (2.5 ± 0.4‰ and 2.1 ± 0.3‰, respectively), while tissue differences in δ13C values were more variable between species (2.3 ± 0.6‰ and 0.7 ± 0.6‰, respectively), likely a result of tissue composition. The overall δ15N and δ13C values of dermis and muscle were highly correlated for blue sharks and for silky sharks with the exception of silky shark δ13C values. This pattern indicates that dermis isotope values are able to provide a proxy for muscle tissue, similar to that previously reported for fin, accepting dermis-specific diet-tissue discrimination factors. Tissue-specific ontogenetic isotopic variation for the silky shark, and the low regression slope value between dermis and muscle δ13C values, however, may suggest that dermis and muscle tissue have different isotopic turnover rates. These data demonstrate that dermis yields valuable isotope data to examine the trophic ecology and feeding/movement behavior of sharks, but further work is required to address dermis-specific turnover rates and diet-tissue discrimination factors.",Dermis | Pelagic shark | Stable isotope,3,1,,20123104120001,National Natural Science Foundation of China

Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, exhibit alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) where males exist in two phenotypes: large “hooknose” males and smaller “jacks” that reach sexual maturity after only 1 year in seawater. The mechanisms that determine “jacking rate”—the rate at which males precociously sexually mature—are known to involve both genetics and differential growth rates, where individuals that become jacks exhibit higher growth earlier in life. The additive genetic components have been studied and it is known that jack sires produce significantly more jack offspring than hooknose sires, and vice versa. The current study was the first to investigate both additive and non-additive genetic components underlying jacking through the use of a full-factorial breeding design using all hooknose sires. The effect of dams and sires descendant from a marker-assisted broodstock program that identified “high performance” and “low performance” lines using growth- and survival-related gene markers was also studied. Finally, the relative growth of jack, hooknose, and female offspring was examined. No significant dam, sire, or interaction effects were observed in this study, and the maternal, additive, and non-additive components underlying jacking were small. Differences in jacking rates in this study were determined by dam performance line, where dams that originated from the low performance line produced significantly more jacks. Jack offspring in this study had a significantly larger body size than both hooknose males and females starting 1 year post-fertilization. This study provides novel information regarding the genetic architecture underlying ARTs in Chinook salmon that could have implications for the aquaculture industry, where jacks are not favoured due to their small body size and poor flesh quality.",Alternative reproductive tactics | Chinook salmon | Differential growth | Jacking | Maternal effects | Non-additive effects,1,0,,undefined,

Multimodal signals used in intra- and interspecific discrimination can serve as redundant signals, or each modality may convey unique information. Furthermore, signals in different modalities may show different transmission properties through different habitats. In this study we investigated how two congeneric wrens, rufous-and-white wrens, Thryophilus rufalbus, and banded wrens, Thryophilus pleurostictus, use acoustic and visual signals for species discrimination in tropical forest habitats. We coupled song playback experiments with visual models to assess the importance of these signals, both in combination and in isolation. We assessed vegetation density in the territories of both species to assess whether more densely vegetated territories influence the use of visual signals. We presented both rufous-and-white wrens and banded wrens with conspecific and congeneric song treatments, model treatments and song-accompanied-by-model treatments. We found that both species responded strongly to song and song-accompanied-by-model treatments, but showed little or no response when the model was presented alone. These results suggest that wrens rely heavily on acoustic signals and very little on visual signals for discrimination. The species differed in their response to conspecific and congeneric trials, with rufous-and-white wrens showing little response to the congeneric trials but banded wrens responding strongly to both conspecific and congeneric trials. The asymmetrical response to the playback trials suggests that there may be a social dominance relationship between these two species, with rufous-and-white wrens being dominant over banded wrens.

Traps playing the reproductive call caught more round gobies than traps playing either the silent or aggressive calls, with the largest difference seen in May, before water temperatures got too warm for round goby reproduction at our shallow study site. Within the grunt traps, females and non-reproductive males were caught more frequently than spawning males and other species were captured at very low rates. Taken together, these results represent a proof-of-concept that acoustic traps may be viable for round goby control in vulnerable areas while not reducing native species numbers. While we are not arguing that acoustic traps will significantly reduce round goby populations throughout their range, they do represent a low-impact method for protecting vulnerable habitats and may be deployed to measure establishment of spawning populations in new areas.",Acoustic signalling | Acoustic trap | Communication | Invasive species | Round goby control,4,0,NSERC,#261405-2008,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

This phenomenon is known as the ‘dear enemy’ effect and it occurs because strangers represent a considerably higher threat to territory take-over compared to neighbours. Some evidence has suggested that large repertoires may constrain neighbour–stranger discrimination. We tested whether songbirds with large repertoires exhibit neighbour–stranger discrimination, conducting a playback study on a songbird with a large vocal repertoire, and a comparative analysis of the dear enemy effect across all published studies of songbirds. In our playback study, we broadcast neighbour and stranger songs within the breeding territories of red-eyed vireos, Vireo olivaceus, a songbird species with a large song repertoire (ca. 50 songs per individual). Vireos responded significantly more aggressively to playback of stranger versus neighbour songs; subjects approached closer to the loudspeaker, had a lower latency to approach the loudspeaker, spent more time near the loudspeaker and sang more soft songs during stranger trials than during neighbour trials. We examined song sharing between red-eyed vireos and found low levels of song sharing between neighbours, suggesting that red-eyed vireos may discriminate among conspecifics based on individually distinctive song types. We then conducted a comparative analysis of neighbour–stranger discrimination across the published literature on songbirds, using a phylogenetically controlled analysis to explore whether species with large repertoires are less likely to discriminate between neighbours and strangers. Across 34 species, we found no evidence that songbirds with large repertoires are constrained in their ability to distinguish between neighbours and strangers. We conclude that large song repertoires do not inhibit neighbour–stranger discrimination in red-eyed vireos specifically, or songbirds generally.",dear enemy effect | individual recognition | neighbour–stranger discrimination | red-eyed vireo | soft song | song repertoire | song sharing,8,0,,undefined,Government of Ontario

Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. Understanding patterns in avian migration phenology and the proximate mechanisms for such patterns is important for assessing behavioural responses of individuals or populations to climate change. Among songbirds, protandry in spring is a common pattern; phenology in fall is less well described. Using tracking data collected from geolocators deployed at a breeding site, and capture data from banding stations, we assessed fall and spring migration phenology of an Arctic-breeding passerine, the Snow Bunting (Plectrophenax nivalis), by sex and age. We measured migration timing, speed, and distance, as well as duration of migration stopovers to test proximate mechanisms for observed sex and age differences in spring and fall migration phenology. During fall migration, hatch-year birds preceded adults, and adult males tended to precede adult females; however, there remained extensive variation by year. Males and females tracked directly arrived at winter sites at approximately the same time. During early spring migration, Snow Buntings exhibited moderate protandry, where after-second-year males preceded all other age-sex classes by ~6 days, on average. Surprisingly, protandry was not apparent at late spring migration or at breeding arrival. Instead, arrival dates by sex and age appeared highly variable between years. The winter site arrival date was predicted by fall migration departure date, total number of stopover days, migration speed, and migration distance. The breeding site arrival date was similarly predicted by spring migration departure date, total stopover days, and migration speed. Our results provide key baseline data for monitoring ongoing changes in migration phenology of this important Arctic-breeding songbird, as climate change effects become more pronounced across temperate and Arctic regions.",Autumn migration | Banding data | Climate change | Geolocators | Migration timing,11,0,,undefined,

Correct species identifications are of tremendous importance for invasion ecology, as mistakes could lead to misdirecting limited resources against harmless species or inaction against problematic ones. DNA barcoding is becoming a promising and reliable tool for species identifications, however the efficacy of such molecular taxonomy depends on gene region(s) that provide a unique sequence to differentiate among species and on availability of reference sequences in existing genetic databases. Here, we assembled a list of aquatic and terrestrial non-indigenous species (NIS) and checked two leading genetic databases for corresponding sequences of six genome regions used for DNA barcoding. The genetic databases were checked in 2010, 2012, and 2016. All four aquatic kingdoms (Animalia, Chromista, Plantae and Protozoa) were initially equally represented in the genetic databases, with 64, 65, 69, and 61 % of NIS included, respectively. Sequences for terrestrial NIS were present at rates of 58 and 78 % for Animalia and Plantae, respectively. Six years later, the number of sequences for aquatic NIS increased to 75, 75, 74, and 63 % respectively, while those for terrestrial NIS increased to 74 and 88 % respectively. Genetic databases are marginally better populated with sequences of terrestrial NIS of plants compared to aquatic NIS and terrestrial NIS of animals. The rate at which sequences are added to databases is not equal among taxa. Though some groups of NIS are not detectable at all based on available data—mostly aquatic ones—encouragingly, current availability of sequences of taxa with environmental and/or economic impact is relatively good and continues to increase with time.",Aquatic taxa | Biological invasion | DNA barcoding | Molecular databases | Species identification | Terrestrial taxa,13,1,,undefined,

Background: One hypothesis to explain the blue-green colour of the eggs of many bird species is that it is a sexually-selected signal of the laying female's quality, which males use to determine their investment. This hypothesis requires that eggshell pigmentation carries a cost or is otherwise linked to female quality. One potential cost is that biliverdin, a haem derivative and the pigment responsible for eggshell colouration, is limiting. To assess this potential cost, we attempted to manipulate haematocrit and haemoglobin in free-living European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris Linnaeus). Upon collecting unmanipulated first clutches, we treated females with phenylhydrazine (PHZ), a haemolytic agent, and measured the blue-green chroma and reproductive performance of replacement clutches. We also investigated whether eggshell colour was associated with haematocrit or haemoglobin levels in unmanipulated first clutches. To test whether eggshell colour might act as a sexual signal, we examined associations between eggshell colour and reproductive performance, as well as the provisioning rate of the male. Results: PHZ-treatment did not affect eggshell colour in replacement clutches. In unmanipulated first clutches, eggshell colour was not correlated with haematocrit or haemoglobin levels. Eggshell colour was correlated with female mass in unmanipulated first clutches but not replacement clutches. Chicks from eggs with higher eggshell colour had higher haemoglobin levels and longer tarsi just prior to fledging, suggesting that eggshell colour could reflect brood quality. However, eggshell colour was not correlated with the provisioning rate of the male or any other measure of reproductive performance. Conclusions: We found no evidence to support the hypothesis that the availability of resources required for the synthesis of pigment limits eggshell colour in European starlings, or that eggshell colour is used by males to determine their level of reproductive investment. We found little evidence that eggshell colour is correlated with female or offspring quality in this species.",Eggshell colour | Haematocrit | Sexual signal,2,1,,undefined,

The ability of individuals to distinguish conspecifics from similar-looking congeners has important evolutionary consequences, yet few studies have determined which specific visual characteristics are used for species recognition, and whether closely related species use the same characteristics. In particular, sympatry with similar-looking congeners may influence which traits are important in species recognition. We presented elegant trogons, Trogon elegans, and black-headed trogons, Trogon melanocephalus, with models that closely resembled conspecifics and models that differed in either the colour of the belly, the colour of the upperparts or the tail-barring pattern, while broadcasting species-specific songs. Elegant trogons showed significantly more aggression towards the conspecific and tail models, suggesting that belly and back colour, but not tail-barring pattern, are important for species recognition in this species. In contrast, the black-headed trogon approached all models very closely, except for the conspecific model. We interpret this counterintuitive behaviour as reluctance to approach an unknown conspecific, suggesting that all three plumage traits are important for species recognition in black-headed trogons. Because the elegant trogon is not sympatric with a similar-looking congener, we argue that they may lack the ability to discriminate fine-barring tail differences or overlook this trait. Sympatry with the similar-looking violaceous trogon may have influenced species recognition in black-headed trogons, favouring the use of all three plumage characteristics, including tail-banding patterns, which differ between these species. Alternatively, it is possible that incongruent stimuli are attended to differently, with elegant trogons focusing on the acoustic traits and black-headed trogons focusing on visual cues. Nevertheless, our study provides the first experimental evidence that specific plumage patches are used for species recognition and that closely related species may use different traits for species recognition. Our findings also suggest that the presence of a similar-looking congener can influence which traits are important in species recognition.",Character displacement | Conspecific | Discrimination ability | Heterospecific | Interspecies | Niche competition | Plumage characteristics | Sexual selection | Species recognition,1,0,,undefined,

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are classified as one the most extremely regulated anthropogenic contaminants and they have been deeply probed in aquatic ecosystems. However, there is very limited understanding of the population level effects of exposure to PCBs on terrestrial animal species and this has been unanimously indicated as a critical gap in ecological risk assessment. To bridge this information gap, we integrated an individual-based model (IBM) framework into toxicokinetics resulting in a deeper ecological insight to simulate the accumulation of a hypothetical PCB in a terrestrial three-level food chain at the population level. We then validated our simulated system utilizing the observed field bioaccumulation factors in a well-studied terrestrial prey-predator, caribou-wolf. Key findings of the present study indicate that in a PCB-contaminated environment, where all food sources contain some amount of contaminants, producing more offspring results in lower toxic concentration in herbivores (prey) and higher concentration in carnivores (predator). Our novel contribution in this work is that we have achieved a validated system that enables us to investigate toxicokinetics in any animal species involved in a prey-predation interaction by providing lipid, non-lipid, and water fractions in their bodies. Additionally, we demonstrated how using IBM modelling approach could facilitate ecological risk assessment by offering detailed information of generations spanning as many years as required.",Ecological risk | Individual-based model | Polychlorinated biphenyls | Population-level assessment | Toxicokinetics,1,0,,undefined,

The GAM displayed high variability of annual CPUE, with a peak value of 0·026 N. brevirostris per hook day (hooks day-1) in 2000. The temporal pattern of CPUE indicated an abundance trend with a complete cycle, from trough to trough, occurring over a period of approximately 18 years. The 1982-1989 survey period saw the highest proportion of mature individuals (19·8%) and the smallest average pre-caudal length (LPC; 124·8 cm). The 1992-2002 survey period had the highest average annual CPUE (0·018 hooks day-1), while the 2003-2014 research period saw largest average LPC size (134·8 cm) and the lowest average CPUE values (0·009 hooks day-1) of the entire research period.

With climate change resulting in unpredictable sea ice conditions between years, it is crucial to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the subsequent effects on Arctic marine ecosystems. Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) play a key role in the Arctic marine food web, serving as a food source that is estimated to contribute up to 75 % of energy transfer to higher trophic levels. To investigate Arctic cod residency and distribution in Resolute Bay (74°44′N, 095°04′W), 85 individuals from four locations in the bay were captured, measured, weighed, implanted with acoustic tags and subsequently tracked on an acoustic array of 49 receivers. Two main periods of residence in the bay were identified, the first in open water and the second under ice cover, and both concluded with a collective mass departure of fish. A generalised linear mixed model was used to investigate the influence of variables on Arctic cod presence/absence in the bay, indicating that ingress and egress were influenced by environmental changes, particularly those associated with the transition from open-water to the ice-covered period. Timing and distribution, during the study period, appeared to be influenced by a combination of physiological acclimation, and a balance between resource availability and refuge from predators. Receiver site Residence Index (RI) analysis revealed strong site fidelity of fish towards the northern areas of the bay, and this behaviour was consistent between tagging groups and individuals, indicating that the majority of tagged cod were representative of a single school. This study represents the first employment of acoustic telemetry to monitor the movements of individual Arctic cod over 9 months, incorporating both open-water and ice-covered periods.",Acoustic telemetry | Boreogadus saida | GLMM | High Arctic | Residence Index,12,0,,undefined,

The stability of consumer-resource systems can depend on the form of feeding interactions (i.e. functional responses). Size-based models predict interactions - and thus stability - based on consumer-resource size ratios. However, little is known about how interaction contexts (e.g. simple or complex habitats) might alter scaling relationships. Addressing this, we experimentally measured interactions between a large size range of aquatic predators (4-6400 mg over 1347 feeding trials) and an invasive prey that transitions among habitats: from the water column (3D interactions) to simple and complex benthic substrates (2D interactions). Simple and complex substrates mediated successive reductions in capture rates - particularly around the unimodal optimum - and promoted prey population stability in model simulations. Many real consumer-resource systems transition between 2D and 3D interactions, and along complexity gradients. Thus, Context-Dependent Scaling (CDS) of feeding interactions could represent an unrecognised aspect of food webs, and quantifying the extent of CDS might enhance predictive ecology.",Body size | Density dependence | Functional response | Habitat complexity | Invasive species | Population stability | Predator-prey dynamics | Scaling | Type II | Type III,26,1,,undefined,

Federal funding for basic scientific research is the cornerstone of societal progress, economy, health and well-being. There is a direct relationship between financial investment in science and a nation's scientific discoveries, making it a priority for governments to distribute public funding appropriately in support of the best science. However, research grant proposal success rate and funding level can be skewed toward certain groups of applicants, and such skew may be driven by systemic bias arising during grant proposal evaluation and scoring. Policies to best redress this problem are not well established. Here, we show that funding success and grant amounts for applications to Canada's Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) Discovery Grant program (2011-2014) are consistently lower for applicants from small institutions. This pattern persists across applicant experience levels, is consistent among three criteria used to score grant proposals, and therefore is interpreted as representing systemic bias targeting applicants from small institutions. When current funding success rates are projected forward, forecasts reveal that future science funding at small schools in Canada will decline precipitously in the next decade, if skews are left uncorrected. We show that a recently-adopted pilot program to bolster success by lowering standards for select applicants from small institutions will not erase funding skew, nor will several other post-evaluation corrective measures. Rather, to support objective and robust review of grant applications, it is necessary for research councils to address evaluation skew directly, by adopting procedures such as blind review of research proposals and bibliometric assessment of performance. Such measures will be important in restoring confidence in the objectivity and fairness of science funding decisions. Likewise, small institutions can improve their research success by more strongly supporting productive researchers and developing competitive graduate programming opportunities.",,10,1,,undefined,

Vertebral band pair counts were then determined for a larger set of white sharks from the SWI (140–422 cm FL, n = 51) resulting in age ranges of 1–38 years. The Gompertz growth model best described the SWI data, with an asymptotic size (L∞) of 496.77 cm FL and length at birth (L0) of 134.08 cm FL. The results of this study indicate white sharks in the SWI are longer-lived and grow more slowly compared to past estimates, but these data are more similar to recent age and growth estimates from other geographically distinct populations. This has important implications for the management of this species in the waters off southern Africa.",,4,0,,undefined,

Background: Thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is a plasma zymogen, which can be converted to activated TAFI (TAFIa) through proteolytic cleavage by thrombin, plasmin, and most effectively thrombin in complex with the endothelial cofactor thrombomodulin (TM). TAFIa is a carboxypeptidase that cleaves carboxyl terminal lysine and arginine residues from protein and peptide substrates, including plasminogen-binding sites on cell surface receptors. Carboxyl terminal lysine residues play a pivotal role in enhancing cell surface plasminogen activation to plasmin. Plasmin has many critical functions including cleaving components of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which enhances invasion and migration of cancer cells. We therefore hypothesized that TAFIa could act to attenuate metastasis. Methods: To assess the role of TAFIa in breast cancer metastasis, in vitro migration and invasion assays, live cell proteolysis and cell proliferation using MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cells were carried out in the presence of a TAFIa inhibitor, recombinant TAFI variants, or soluble TM. Results: Inhibition of TAFIa with potato tuber carboxypeptidase inhibitor increased cell invasion, migration and proteolysis of both cell lines, whereas addition of TM resulted in a decrease in all these parameters. A stable variant of TAFIa, TAFIa-CIIYQ, showed enhanced inhibitory effects on cell invasion, migration and proteolysis. Furthermore, pericellular plasminogen activation was significantly decreased on the surface of MDA-MB-231 and SUM149 cells following treatment with various concentrations of TAFIa. Conclusions: Taken together, these results indicate a vital role for TAFIa in regulating pericellular plasminogen activation and ultimately ECM proteolysis in the breast cancer microenvironment. Enhancement of TAFI activation in this microenvironment may be a therapeutic strategy to inhibit invasion and prevent metastasis of breast cancer cells.",Breast cancer | Extracellular proteolysis | Metastasis | Plasminogen | TAFI | Thrombomodulin,8,1,,undefined,

Reclaiming wetlands following open pit mining for industrial oil sand extraction is challenging due to the physical and chemical conditions of the post-mined landscape. The aim of our study was to examine and compare the influence of oil sands process water (OSPW) and material (fine fluid tails or FFT) on the plant community composition of created wetlands. Compared to created-unamended and natural wetlands, the created wetlands amended with OSPW and/or FFT (created-tailings wetlands) had significantly higher water salinity, conductivity, dissolved oxygen concentration and lower oxidative-reductive potential. Water chemistry parameters of created-unamended did not differ significantly from those of natural wetlands. The sediment of created wetlands had significantly less moisture, total nitrogen, and organic content than the natural wetlands. The application of OSPW/FFT in created wetlands will likely lead to initial vegetation composition atypical of natural regional wetlands. For the objective of reclaiming vegetation composition to the status of natural regional wetlands, unamended wetlands were the best reclamation option, based on the physical and chemical parameters measured. Despite being the favored reclamation option, created-unamended wetlands' physical and chemical characteristics remain atypical of natural wetlands. Most significantly, the basin morphometry of created wetlands was significantly different from that of naturally-formed wetlands in the region, and this appears to partly explain difference in vegetation composition. We also demonstrate that species richness alone is not a useful measure in wetland monitoring. Instead, plant community composition is a better indicator of wetland conditions.",Industrial alteration | Plant community | Restoration | Wetland reclamation,7,0,,undefined,Total

Around the world, artificially drained agricultural lands are significant sources of reactive nitrogen to stream ecosystems, creating substantial stream health problems. One management strategy is the deployment of denitrification enhancement tools. Here, we evaluate the factors affecting the potential of denitrifying bioreactors to improve stream health and ecosystem services. The performance of bioreactors and the structure and functioning of stream biotic communities are linked by environmental parameters like dissolved oxygen and nitratenitrogen concentrations, dissolved organic carbon availability, flow and temperature regimes, and fine sediment accumulations. However, evidence of bioreactors' ability to improve waterway health and ecosystem services is lacking. To improve the potential of bioreactors to enhance desirable stream ecosystem functioning, future assessments of field-scale bioreactors should evaluate the influences of bioreactor performance on ecological indicators such as primary production, organic matter processing, stream metabolism, and invertebrate and fish assemblage structure and function. These stream health impact assessments should be conducted at ecologically relevant spatial and temporal scales. Bioreactors have great potential to make significant contributions to improving water quality, stream health, and ecosystem services if they are tailored to site-specific conditions and implemented strategically with land-based and stream-based mitigation tools within watersheds.

Anthropogenic modifications to the natural environment have profound effects on wild animals, through structural changes to natural ecosystems as well as anthropogenic disturbances such as light and noise. For animals that migrate nocturnally, anthropogenic light can interfere with migration routes, flight altitudes, and social activities that accompany migration, such as acoustic communication. We investigated the effect of anthropogenic light on nocturnal migration of birds through the Great Lakes ecosystem. Specifically, we recorded the vocal activity of migrating birds and compared the number of nocturnal flight calls produced above rural areas with ground-level artificial lights compared to nearby areas without lights. We show that more nocturnal flight calls are detected over artificially lit areas. The median number of nocturnal flight calls recorded at sites with artificial lights (31 per night, interquartile range: 15-135) was 3 times higher than at nearby sites without artificial lights (11 per night, interquartile range: 4-39). By contrast, the number of species detected at lit and unlit sites did not differ significantly (artificially lit sites: 6.5 per night, interquartile range: 5.0-8.8; unlit sites: 4.5 per night, interquartile range: 2.0-7.0). We conclude that artificial lighting changes the behavior of nocturnally migrating birds. The increased detections could be a result of ground-level light sources altering bird behavior during migration. For example, birds might have changed their migratory route to pass over lit areas, flown at lower altitudes over lit areas, increased their calling rate over lit areas, or remained longer over lit areas. Our results for ground-level lights correspond to previous findings demonstrating that migratory birds are influenced by lights on tall structures.",anthropogenic light | birds | light pollution | migration | night flight calls | nocturnal flight calls,10,0,,undefined,

Aim: The urgent need for large-scale spatio-temporal assessments of biodiversity in the face of rapid environmental change prompts technological advancements in species identification and biomonitoring such as metabarcoding. The high-throughput DNA sequencing of bulk samples offers many advantages over traditional morphological identification for describing community composition. Our objective was to evaluate the applicability of metabarcoding to identify species in taxonomically complex samples, evaluate biodiversity trends across broad geographical and temporal scales and facilitate cross-study comparisons. Location: Marine and freshwater ports along Canadian coastlines (Pacific, Arctic and Atlantic) and the Great Lakes. Methods: We used metabarcoding of bulk zooplankton samples to identify species and profile biodiversity across habitats and seasons in busy commercial ports. A taxonomic assignment approach circumventing sequence clustering was implemented to provide increased resolution and accuracy compared to pre-clustering. Results: Taxonomic classification of over seven million sequences identified organisms spanning around 400 metazoan families and complements previous surveys based on morphological identification. Metabarcoding revealed over 30 orders that were previously not reported, while certain taxonomic groups were underrepresented because of depauperate reference databases. Despite the limitations of assigning metabarcoding data to the species level, zooplankton communities were distinct among coastlines and significantly divergent among marine, freshwater and estuarine habitats even at the family level. Furthermore, biodiversity varied substantially across two seasons reaching a beta diversity of 0.9 in a sub-Arctic port exposed to high vessel traffic. Main Conclusions: Metabarcoding offers a powerful and sensitive approach to conduct large-scale biodiversity surveys and allows comparability across studies when rooted in taxonomy. We highlight ways of overcoming current limitations of metabarcoding for identifying species and assessing biodiversity, which has important implications for detecting organisms at low abundance such as endangered species and early invaders.

Many species are adapted for fasting during parts of their life cycle. For species undergoing extreme fasts, lipid stores are mobilized and accumulated contaminants can be released to exert toxicological effects. However, it is unknown if short-term fasting events may have a similar effect. The objective of this study was to determine if short successive fasts are related to contaminant levels in liver and plasma of birds. In ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis), both members of the pair alternate between incubating the nest for several hours (during which they fast) and foraging, making them a useful model for examining this question. Birds were equipped with miniature data loggers recording time and GPS position for two days to determine the proportion and duration of time birds spent in these two activities. Liver and plasma samples were collected, and halogenated flame retardants (HFRs) (PBDEs and dechlorane plus) and organochlorines (OCs) (PCBs, DDTs, and chlordane-related compounds) were determined. Most birds (79%) exhibited plasma lipid content below 1%, indicating a likely fasted state, and plasma lipid percent declined with the number of hours spent at the nest site. The more time birds spent at their nest site, the higher were their plasma and liver concentrations of HFRs. However, body condition indices were unrelated to either the amount of time birds fasted at the nest site or contaminant levels, suggesting that lipid mobilization might not have been severe enough to affect overall body condition of birds and to explain the relationship between fasting and HFR concentrations. A similar relationship between fasting and OC levels was not observed, suggesting that different factors are affecting short-term temporal variations in concentrations of these two classes of contaminants. This study demonstrates that short fasts can be related to increased internal contaminant exposure in birds and that this may be a confounding factor in research and monitoring involving tissue concentrations of HFRs in wild birds.",Birds | Dechlorane plus | Fasting | Incubation | Lipid mobilization | PBDEs | PCBs,3,0,FQRNT,385787,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Many animals produce sounds that overlap the sounds of others. In some animals, overlapping is thought to be an aggressive signal important in resource defence. Yet, overlapping can also occur by chance, and therefore its function is controversial. In this study, we conducted two experiments to test the function of overlapping in black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus. In experiment 1, we simulated territorial intrusions by broadcasting songs inside established chickadee territories. Resident males overlapped the playback-simulated intruders significantly less than expected by chance, as in most species in which overlapping has been described. Chickadees also overlapped more when they were farther from the intruder. This pattern suggests that chickadees avoid overlapping as a mechanism for reducing acoustic interference ('interference avoidance hypothesis'). However, the pattern could also constitute submissive signalling if chickadees signal de-escalation (associated with greater distance between opponents) through increasing rates of overlapping ('submissive signalling hypothesis'). Therefore, in experiment 2, we contrasted these two hypotheses by comparing responses to playback stimuli with low or high interference potential and low or high signal value. We manipulated interference potential by broadcasting stimuli at different amplitudes. We manipulated signal value by broadcasting either song stimuli, which elicit aggression, or white noise stimuli with matching time-amplitude characteristics. If overlapping is a submissive signal, then we predicted that chickadees would avoid overlapping song stimuli, but not white noise stimuli, which lack signal value. Contrary to this prediction, chickadees overlapped song and white noise stimuli equally often, but significantly less often than expected by chance. Furthermore, chickadees overlapped both types of stimuli more often when they were broadcast at lower amplitudes (i.e. lower interference potential). Together, these findings provide compelling evidence that overlapping is not a signal in this species, and that chickadees avoid overlapping both biotic and abiotic sounds as a mechanism for reducing interference.",Acoustic interference | Aggressive signal | Agonistic signal | Birdsong | Black-capped chickadee | Frequency matching | Nightingale | Overlapping | Song matching,6,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

Background: In cancer alternative RNA splicing represents one mechanism for flexible gene regulation, whereby protein isoforms can be created to promote cell growth, division and survival. Detecting novel splice junctions in the cancer transcriptome may reveal pathways driving tumorigenic events. In this regard, RNA-Seq, a high-throughput sequencing technology, has expanded the study of cancer transcriptomics in the areas of gene expression, chimeric events and alternative splicing in search of novel biomarkers for the disease. Results: In this study, we propose a new two-dimensional peak finding method for detecting differential splice junctions in prostate cancer using RNA-Seq data. We have designed an integrative process that involves a new two-dimensional peak finding algorithm to combine junctions and then remove irrelevant introns across different samples within a population.

Our understanding of anthropogenic stressor effects on wetland biota and ecosystem processes would benefit from better defined relationships between landscape and local stressors. We assessed the connection between watershed land use and local habitat and local disturbance in Great Lakes coastal ecosystems across a full range of anthropogenic stress. In addition, we identified dominant structuring variables, described redundancy, and assessed the relative influence of local versus watershed scale features on local habitat quality with on-site assessments conducted at 143 sample sites. Associations between habitat variables and watershed stressors were found, but only a small proportion of variation was explained. Overall, watershed agriculture was a stronger predictor of local habitat variables than was development. Variance partitioning revealed that disturbance and land use accounted for more variance in habitat than spatial factors or wetland type. This indicates that local and watershed-scale assessments are discrete approaches that document stress at different hierarchical scales and an assumed direct connection between watershed stress and local habitat and disturbance is an over-simplification. Therefore, assessments of stress should include both watershed scale and on-site habitat assessments. Furthermore, these results indicate that local scale mitigation/restoration could minimize negative impacts of changing land use.",Great Lakes coastal ecosystems | Habitat degradation | Multi-level assessment | Stressor index,1,0,,undefined,

Polar Regions are experiencing environmental changes at unprecedented rates. These changes can spread throughout entire food webs from lower trophic levels to apex predators. As many top predators forage over large areas, these indirect effects may be associated with large-scale patterns of climate variability. Using global climate indices that are known to impact the Southern Ocean ecosystem (the El Niño Southern Oscillation and Antarctic Oscillation Indices) we assessed their efficacy to predict variation in the demographic parameters of Antarctic seabirds. First, we used a long-term dataset on adult survival (estimated from capture-mark-recapture data) and reproduction of Antarctic petrel Thalassoica antarctica, from the largest known breeding colony (Svarthamaren, Dronning Maud Land) and examined whether large-scale oceanographic fluctuations impact survival and reproduction. Second, we conducted an exhaustive literature review to determine whether the effects of large-scale environmental variability on Antarctic seabirds have a coherent fingerprint across the Antarctic continent and nearby islands. We found that most of the variation in both reproductive success, timing of hatching, and survival of Antarctic petrels can be accurately modeled using the two modes of large-scale climate variability in Antarctica. The literature review, combined with the results from our field study, suggests that while the anticipated trends in the global patterns of climatic variability will generally have detrimental effects on populations of top predators in the Southwest Atlantic, these conclusions cannot be extrapolated to all seabird populations in Antarctica without additional data.",,13,0,,undefined,

Location: Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, Gulf of Oman and Arabian Gulf. Methods: Mitochondrial DNA cytochrome-c oxidase subunit-I and nuclear DNA (S7) sequences were obtained for C. hemistiktos sampled throughout its distributional range. Phylogeographical and population-level analyses were used to assess patterns of genetic structure and to identify barriers to dispersal. Concurrently, age-based demographic analyses using otoliths determined differences in growth and longevity between regions. Results: Our analyses revealed significant genetic structure congruent with growth parameter differences observed across sampling sites, suggesting cryptic speciation between populations in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden versus the Gulf of Oman and Arabian Gulf. Coalescence analyses indicated these two regions have been isolated for > 800,000 years. Main conclusions: Our results indicate historical disruption to gene flow and a contemporary dispersal barrier in the Arabian Sea, which C. hemistiktos larvae are unable to effectively traverse. This provides yet another example of a (cryptic) species with high dispersive potential whose range is delimited by a lack of suitable habitat between locations or an inability to successfully recruit at the range edge.",Coral reef fish | Demography | Mitochondrial DNA | Nuclear DNA | Phylogeography | Population genetics | Serranidae,5,0,,undefined,

The phenomenon of chaotic genetic patchiness is a pattern commonly seen in marine organisms, particularly those with demersal adults and pelagic larvae. This pattern is usually associated with sweepstakes recruitment and variable reproductive success. Here we investigate the biological underpinnings of this pattern in a species of marine goby Coryphopterus personatus. We find that populations of this species show tell-tale signs of chaotic genetic patchiness including: small, but significant, differences in genetic structure over short distances; a non-equilibrium or ""chaotic"" pattern of differentiation among locations in space; and within locus, within population deviations from the expectations of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). We show that despite having a pelagic larval stage, and a wide distribution across Caribbean coral reefs, this species forms groups of highly related individuals at small spatial scales (<10 metres). These spatially clustered family groups cause the observed deviations from HWE and local population differentiation, a finding that is rarely demonstrated, but could be more common than previously thought.",,19,1,,227965,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

In this study, the long term effect of different microbial stressing agents on hydrogen (H2) production was examined using repeated batch cultivations. When compared to thermophilic cultures, higher H2 yields were observed in mesophilic cultures receiving repeated glucose addition. Methane production was only observed in control mesophilic cultures receiving repeated 5 glucose additions. Lower hydrogenase evolution specific activity was observed in thermophilic cultures (except alkali-treated cultures) compared to mesophilic cultures. For both mesophilic and thermophilic cultures, the hydrogenase uptake specific activity of the untreated control cultures exhibited higher levels of activity than the pretreated cultures. A flux balance analysis (FBA) showed negligible homoacetogenic flux in mesophilic cultures pretreated with linoleic acid (LA) and loading shock (LS) after successive batch cultivations. The homoacetogenic flux accounted for approximately 98% loss in the H2 yield in untreated mesophilic control cultures. Both homoacetogens (Eubacterium sp.) and aceticlastic methanogens (Methanosaeta sp. and Methanosarcina sp.) were abundant in the control cultures. In comparison, Clostridium sp. were dominant in mesophilic stress treated cultures whereas under thermophilic conditions, the dominant microorganisms were Flavobacterium sp., Bacillus sp., Thermoanaerobacter sp., Bacteroides sp., Lactobacillus sp. and Thioalkalivibrio sp.",Flux balance analysis | Homoacetogens | Hydrogenase activity | Inoculum pretreatment | Mixed anaerobic culture,8,0,BES,13320,University of Windsor

A series of genetically related lines of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) integrate a progressive deficiency in major storage proteins, the 7S globulin phaseolin and lectins. SARC1 integrates a lectin-like protein, arcelin-1 from a wild common bean accession. SMARC1N-PN1 is deficient in major lectins, including erythroagglutinating phytohemagglutinin (PHA-E) but not α-amylase inhibitor, and incorporates also a deficiency in phaseolin. SMARC1-PN1 is intermediate and shares the phaseolin deficiency. Sanilac is the parental background. To understand the genomic basis for variations in protein profiles previously determined by proteomics, the genotypes were submitted to short-fragment genome sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq 2000/2500 platform. Reads were aligned to reference sequences and subjected to de novo assembly. The results of the analyses identified polymorphisms responsible for the lack of specific storage proteins, as well as those associated with large differences in storage protein expression. SMARC1N-PN1 lacks the lectin genes pha-E and lec4- B17, and has the pseudogene pdlec1 in place of the functional pha-L gene. While the α-phaseolin gene appears absent, an approximately 20-fold decrease in β-phaseolin accumulation is associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism converting a G-box to an ACGT motif in the proximal promoter. Among residual lectins compensating for storage protein deficiency, mannose lectin FRIL and α-amylase inhibitor 1 genes are uniquely present in SMARC1N-PN1. An approximately 50-fold increase in α-amylase inhibitor like protein accumulation is associated with multiple polymorphisms introducing up to eight potential positive cis-regulatory elements in the proximal promoter specific to SMARC1N-PN1. An approximately 7-fold increase in accumulation of 11S globulin legumin is not associated with variation in proximal promoter sequence, suggesting that the identity of individual proteins involved in proteome rebalancing might also be determined at the translational level.",Common bean | Deletion | Genome sequencing | Introgression | Lectin | Phaseolin | Phaseolus vulgaris,7,1,,undefined,China Scholarship Council

Sensorimotor transformation is one of the most fundamental and ubiquitous functions of the central nervous system (CNS). Although the general organization of the locomotor neural circuitry is relatively well understood, less is known about its activation by sensory inputs and its modulation. Utilizing the lamprey model, a detailed understanding of sensorimotor integration in vertebrates is emerging. In this article, we explore how the vertebrate CNS integrates sensory signals to generate motor behavior by examining the pathways and neural mechanisms involved in the transformation of cutaneous and olfactory inputs into motor output in the lamprey. We then review how 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) acts on these systems by modulating both sensory inputs and motor output. A comprehensive review of this fundamental topic should provide a useful framework in the fields of motor control, sensorimotor integration and neuromodulation.",5-HT | Lamprey | Locomotion | Modulation | Reticulospinal neurons | Sensorimotor,9,1,,undefined,

Previous studies have indicated that sodium salicylate (SS) can cause hearing abnormalities through affecting the central auditory system. In order to understand central effects of the drug, we examined how a single intraperitoneal injection of the drug changed the level of subunits of the type-B γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAB receptor) in the rat's inferior colliculus (IC). Immunohistochemical and western blotting experiments were conducted three hours following a drug injection, as previous studies indicated that a tinnitus-like behavior could be reliably induced in rats within this time period. Results revealed that both subunits of the receptor, GABABR1 and GABABR2, reduced their level over the entire area of the IC. Such a reduction was observed in both cell body and neuropil regions. In contrast, no changes were observed in other brain structures such as the cerebellum. Thus, a coincidence existed between a structure-specific reduction in the level of GABAB receptor subunits in the IC and the presence of a tinnitus-like behavior. This coincidence likely suggests that a reduction in the level of GABAB receptor subunits was involved in the generation of a tinnitus-like behavior and/or used by the nervous system to restore normal hearing following application of SS.",Auditory midbrain | GABA R1 B | GABA R2 B | Immunohistochemistry | Sodium salicylate | Tinnitus,4,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) exhibit extreme differences in coloration of skin, eggs and flesh due to genetic polymorphisms affecting carotenoid deposition, where colour can range from white to bright red. A sympatric population of red and white Chinook salmon occurs in the Quesnel River, British Columbia, where frequencies of each phenotype are relatively equal. In our study, we examined evolutionary mechanisms responsible for the maintenance of the morphs, where we first tested whether morphs were reproductively isolated using microsatellite genotyping, and second, using breeding trials in seminatural spawning channels, we tested whether colour assortative mate choice could be operating to maintain the polymorphism in nature. Next, given extreme difference in carotenoid assimilation and the importance of carotenoids to immune function, we examined mate choice and selection between colour morphs at immune genes (major histocompatibility complex genes: MHC I-A1 and MHC II-B1). In our study, red and white individuals were found to interbreed, and under seminatural conditions, some degree of colour assortative mate choice (71% of matings) was observed. We found significant genetic differences at both MHC genes between morphs, but no evidence of MHC II-B1-based mate choice. White individuals were more heterozygous at MHC II-B1 compared with red individuals, and morphs showed significant allele frequency differences at MHC I-A1. Although colour assortative mate choice is likely not a primary mechanism maintaining the polymorphisms in the population, our results suggest that selection is operating differentially at immune genes in red and white Chinook salmon, possibly due to differences in carotenoid utilization.",assortative mate choice | colour polymorphisms | major histocompatibility complex | microsatellites,13,0,,undefined,

Full factorial breeding designs are useful for quantifying the amount of additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, and maternal variance that explain phenotypic traits. Such variance estimates are important for examining evolutionary potential. Traditionally, full factorial mating designs have been analyzed using a two-way analysis of variance, which may produce negative variance values and is not suited for unbalanced designs. Mixed-effects models do not produce negative variance values and are suited for unbalanced designs. However, extracting the variance components, calculating significance values, and estimating confidence intervals and/or power values for the components are not straightforward using traditional analytic methods. We introduce fullfact - an R package that addresses these issues and facilitates the analysis of full factorial mating designs with mixed-effects models. Here, we summarize the functions of the fullfact package. The observed data functions extract the variance explained by random and fixed effects and provide their significance. We then calculate the additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, and maternal variance components explaining the phenotype. In particular, we integrate nonnormal error structures for estimating these components for nonnormal data types. The resampled data functions are used to produce bootstrap-t confidence intervals, which can then be plotted using a simple function. We explore the fullfact package through a worked example. This package will facilitate the analyses of full factorial mating designs in R, especially for the analysis of binary, proportion, and/or count data types and for the ability to incorporate additional random and fixed effects and power analyses.",Additive genetic effects | Compatible genes | Genetic architecture | Good genes | Mate choice | Maternal effects | Nonadditive genetic effects | North Carolina II design | Statistical power,8,1,,undefined,

Life-history trade-offs are influenced by variation in individual state, with individuals in better condition often completing life-history stages with greater success. Although resource accrual significantly impacts key life-history decisions such as the timing of reproduction, little is known about the underlying mechanisms driving resource accumulation. Baseline corticosterone (CORT, the primary avian glucocorticoid) mediates daily and seasonal energetics, responds to changes in food availability, and has been linked to foraging behavior, making it a strong potential driver of individual variation in resource accrual and deposition. Working with a captive colony of white-winged scoters (Melanitta fusca deglandi), we aimed to causally determine whether variation in baseline CORT drives individual body mass gains mediated through fattening rate (plasma triglycerides corrected for body mass). We implanted individuals with each of three treatment pellets to elevate CORT within a baseline range in a randomized order: control, low dose of CORT, high dose of CORT, then blood sampled and recorded body mass over a two-week period to track changes in baseline CORT, body mass, and fattening rates. The high CORT treatment significantly elevated levels of plasma hormone for a short period of time within the biologically relevant, baseline range for this species, but importantly did not inhibit the function of the HPA (hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal) axis. Furthermore, an elevation in baseline CORT resulted in a consistent increase in body mass throughout the trial period compared to controls. This is some of the first empirical evidence demonstrating that elevations of baseline CORT within a biologically relevant range have a causal, direct, and positive influence on changes in body mass.",Baseline corticosterone | Body mass | Captive study | Manipulation | White-winged scoter,11,1,,undefined,

Maximum power densities from 0.56 to 0.83 W m-2 were observed for MFCs fed with different feedstocks. The maximum COD removed and minimum CE were observed for a GW feed. However, a reverse trend (minimum COD removed and maximum CE) was observed for the FW feed. A maximum COD removal (78%) accompanied with a maximum CE (24%) was observed for a combined feed of FW, PCW plus GW in a 1:1:1 ratio. Lactate, the major byproduct detected, was unutilized by the anodic biofilm community. The organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) could serve as a potential feedstock for electricity generation in MFCs; however, elevated protein levels will lead to reduced COD removal.

Surveys conducted in 2011 and 2012 revealed recurrent presence of one or both species at some sites. Macrophytes in in situ enclosures failed to survive winter conditions, with plant health declining progressively prior to mortality. Water hyacinth seeds were field-collected, identified using Sanger sequencing, and germinated at 28°C with or without scarification. Germination was highest for scarified versus non-scarified seeds. Human introduction was observed at two sites, one involving both species, the other only water hyacinth. These species likely persist through a combination of annual reintroduction (both species) and possibly by production of viable seed (water hyacinth).

Spatial and temporal variation can confound interpretations of relationships within and between species in terms of diet composition, niche size, and trophic position (TP). The cause of dietary variation within species is commonly an ontogenetic niche shift, which is a key dynamic influencing community structure. We quantified spatial and temporal variations in ringed seal (Pusa hispida) diet, niche size, and TP during ontogeny across the Arctic—a rapidly changing ecosystem. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis was performed on 558 liver and 630 muscle samples from ringed seals and on likely prey species from five locations ranging from the High to the Low Arctic. A modest ontogenetic diet shift occurred, with adult ringed seals consuming more forage fish (approximately 80 versus 60 %) and having a higher TP than subadults, which generally decreased with latitude. However, the degree of shift varied spatially, with adults in the High Arctic presenting a more restricted niche size and consuming more Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) than subadults (87 versus 44 %) and adults at the lowest latitude (29 %). The TPs of adult and subadult ringed seals generally decreased with latitude (4.7–3.3), which was mainly driven by greater complexity in trophic structure within the zooplankton communities. Adult isotopic niche size increased over time, likely due to the recent circumpolar increases in subarctic forage fish distribution and abundance. Given the spatial and temporal variability in ringed seal foraging ecology, ringed seals exhibit dietary plasticity as a species, suggesting adaptability in terms of their diet to climate change.",Arctic | Ontogenetic niche shift | Ringed seal | Stable isotopes | Trophic position,26,0,AANDC,undefined,Adam Taliaferro Foundation

Monitoring mercury levels in fish can be costly because variation by space, time, and fish type/size needs to be captured. Here, we explored if compositing fish samples to decrease analytical costs would reduce the effectiveness of the monitoring objectives. Six compositing methods were evaluated by applying them to an existing extensive dataset, and examining their performance in reproducing the fish consumption advisories and temporal trends. The methods resulted in varying amount (average 34-72%) of reductions in samples, but all (except one) reproduced advisories very well (96-97% of the advisories did not change or were one category more restrictive compared to analysis of individual samples). Similarly, the methods performed reasonably well in recreating temporal trends, especially when longer-term and frequent measurements were considered. The results indicate that compositing samples within 5. cm fish size bins or retaining the largest/smallest individuals and compositing in-between samples in batches of 5 with decreasing fish size would be the best approaches. Based on the literature, the findings from this study are applicable to fillet, muscle plug and whole fish mercury monitoring studies. The compositing methods may also be suitable for monitoring Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in fish. Overall, compositing fish samples for mercury monitoring could result in a substantial savings (approximately 60% of the analytical cost) and should be considered in fish mercury monitoring, especially in long-term programs or when study cost is a concern.",Advisories | Compositing/pooling | Fish | Mercury Hg | Monitoring | Sensitive population,2,0,,undefined,

Individual specialization (IS), where individuals within populations irrespective of age, sex, and body size are either specialized or generalized in terms of resource use, has implications on ecological niches and food web structure. Niche size and degree of IS of near-top trophic-level marine predators have been little studied in polar regions or with latitude. We quantified the large-scale latitudinal variation of population- and individual-level niche size and IS in ringed seals (Pusa hispida) and beluga whales (Delphinapterus leucas) using stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analysis on 379 paired ringed seal liver and muscle samples and 124 paired beluga skin and muscle samples from eight locations ranging from the low to high Arctic. We characterized both within- and between-individual variation in predator niche size at each location as well as accounting for spatial differences in the isotopic ranges of potential prey. Total isotopic niche width (TINW) for populations of ringed seals and beluga decreased with increasing latitude. Higher TINW values were associated with greater ecological opportunity (i.e., prey diversity) in the prey fish community which mainly consists of Capelin (Mallotus villosus) and Sand lance (Ammodytes sp.) at lower latitudes and Arctic cod (Boreogadus saida) at high latitudes. In beluga, their dietary consistency between tissues also known as the within-individual component (WIC) increased in a near 1:1 ratio with TINW (slope = 0.84), suggesting dietary generalization, whereas the slope (0.18) of WIC relative to TINW in ringed seals indicated a high degree of individual specialization in ringed seal populations with higher TINWs. Our findings highlight the differences in TINW and level of IS for ringed seals and beluga relative to latitude as a likely response to large-scale spatial variation in ecological opportunity, suggesting species-specific variation in dietary plasticity to spatial differences in prey resources and environmental conditions in a rapidly changing ecosystem. We quantified large-scale latitudinal variation of population- and individual-level niche size and degree of individual specialization in two Arctic marine predators, ringed seals, and beluga whales, using stable isotope analysis. We report an increase in isotopic niche width with decreasing latitude as a result of increased ecological opportunity for both species, as well as species-specific differences in individual niche variability and individual specialization with the varying levels of intraspecific competition and latitude.

Animals use acoustic signals to defend resources against rivals and attract breeding partners. As with many biological traits, acoustic signals may reflect ancestry; closely related species often produce more similar signals than do distantly related species. Whether this similarity in acoustic signals is biologically relevant to animals is poorly understood. We conducted a playback experiment to measure the physical and vocal responses of male songbirds to the songs of both conspecific and allopatric-congeneric animals that varied in their acoustic and genetic similarity. Our subjects were territorial males of four species of neotropical Troglodytes wrens: Brown-throated Wrens (Troglodytes brunneicollis), Cozumel Wrens (T. beani), Clarion Wrens (T. tanneri) and Socorro Wrens (T. sissonii). Our results indicate that birds respond to playback of both conspecific and allopatric-congeneric animals; that acoustic differences increase with genetic distance; and that genetic divergence predicts the strength of behavioural responses to playback, after removing the effects of acoustic similarity between subjects' songs and playback stimuli. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the most distantly related species have the most divergent songs; that male wrens perceive divergence in fine structural characteristics of songs; and that perceptual differences between species reflect evolutionary history. This study offers novel insight into the importance of acoustic divergence of learned signals and receiver responses in species recognition.",Troglodytes | Acoustic distance | Ancestry | Genetic distance | Phylogenetic signal | Songs,7,0,,undefined,

The two-note fee bee song of the black-capped chickadee (Poecile atricapillus) is sung at many different absolute frequencies, but the relative frequencies between the start and end of the fee note (the glissando) and between the fee and the bee notes (the inter-note ratio) are preserved regardless of absolute frequency. If these relative frequencies are experimentally manipulated, birds exhibit reduced behavioural responses to playback of altered songs both in field studies and laboratory studies. Interestingly, males appear to be sensitive to alterations in the glissando, while females appear to be sensitive to alterations in both the glissando and the inter-note ratio. In this study, we sought to determine whether the behaviour of male and female chickadees corresponds to differences in zenk protein immunoreactivity (ZENK-ir) in auditory perceptual regions following playback of fee bee songs with typical and altered pitch ratios. Overall, there was a small but significant sex difference in ZENK-ir (females. ≥ males), but altering relative frequencies did not reduce ZENK-ir compared to typical song. Birds did vocalize less in response to playback of songs that lacked an inter-note interval, but amount of singing fee bee song, chick-a-dee calls, or gargles was not correlated with ZENK-ir in perceptual regions (caudomedial nidopallium, NCM and caudomedial mesopallium, CMM) or in HVC, which is part of the song system.

The songs of many songbird species vary geographically, yet, the songs of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, show remarkable consistency across most of the species' North American range. Previous research has described subtle variations in the song of this species by comparing songs produced by males at distant parts of the species' range (British Columbia and Ontario). In the current study, we used an operant discrimination task to examine whether birds classify the songs produced by males in these two previously studied locations as belonging to distinct open-ended categories. In both experiments, when birds were presented with new songs, they continued to respond to songs from the same geographical location as the songs that were reinforced during initial discrimination training, suggesting that birds were using open-ended categorization. We also presented birds with songs in which we manipulated acoustic features in order to examine the acoustic mechanisms used during discrimination; results provide support that birds use the duration of the song when discriminating, but the results also suggest that birds used additional acoustic features. Taken together, these experiments show that black-capped chickadees classify songs into open-ended, geography-based categories, and provide compelling evidence that perceptible acoustic differences exist in a vocalization that is seemingly consistent across the species' range.",Acoustic discrimination | Black-capped chickadee | Categorization | Geographical variation | Operant conditioning | Song,5,0,,230604,Austrian Science Fund

Rationale Stable isotope analysis (SIA) provides a powerful tool to investigate diverse ecological questions for marine species, but standardized values are required for comparative assessments. For elasmobranchs, their unique osmoregulatory strategy involves retention of 15N-depleted urea in body tissues and this may bias δ15N values. This may be a particular problem for large predatory species, where δ15N discrimination between predator and consumed prey can be small. Methods We evaluated three treatments (deionized water rinsing [DW], chloroform/methanol [LE] and combined chloroform/methanol and deionized water rinsing [LE+DW]) applied to white muscle tissue of 125 individuals from seven pelagic shark species to (i) assess urea and lipid effects on stable isotope values determined by IRMS and (ii) investigate mathematical normalization of these values. Results For all species examined, the δ15N values and C:N ratios increased significantly following all three treatments, identifying that urea removal is required prior to SIA of pelagic sharks. The more marked change in δ15N values following DW (1.3 ± 0.4‰) and LE+DW (1.2 ± 0.6‰) than following LE alone (0.7 ± 0.4‰) indicated that water rinsing was more effective at removing urea. The DW and LE+DW treatments lowered the %N values, resulting in an increase in C:N ratios from the unexpected low values of <2.6 in bulk samples to ~3.1 ± 0.1, the expected value of protein. The δ13C values of all species also increased significantly following LE and LE+DW treatments. Conclusions Given the mean change in δ15N (1.2 ± 0.6‰) and δ13C values (0.7 ± 0.4‰) across pelagic shark species, it is recommended that muscle tissue samples be treated with LE+DW to efficiently extract both urea and lipids to standardize isotopic values. Mathematical normalization of urea and lipid-extracted δ15NLE+DW and δ13CLE+DW values using the lipid-extracted δ15NLE and δ13CLE data were established for all pelagic shark species.",,21,0,,undefined,

Conservation concern regarding the overharvest of global shark populations for meat and fin consumption largely surrounds documented deleterious ecosystem effects, but may be further supported by improved knowledge of possibly high levels in their edible tissues (particularly meat) of the neurotoxin, methylmercury (CH3Hg). For many regions, however, little data exist on shark tissue Hg concentrations, and reasons for Hg variation within and among species or across regions are poorly understood. We quantified total Hg (THg) in 17 shark species (total n=283) from the east coast of South Africa, a top Hg emitter globally. Concentrations varied from means of around 0.1mgkg-1 dry weight (dw) THg in hardnose smoothhound (Mustelus mosis) and whale (Rhincodon typus) sharks to means of over 10mgkg-1 dw in shortfin mako (Isurus oxyrinchus), scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini), white (Carcharodon carcharias) and ragged-tooth (Carcharias taurus) sharks. These sharks had higher THg levels than conspecifics sampled from coastal waters of the North Atlantic and North, mid-, and South Pacific, and although sampling year and shark size may play a confounding role, this result suggests the potential importance of elevated local emissions. Values of THg showed strong, species-specific correlations with length, and nearly half the remaining variation was explained by trophic position (using nitrogen stable isotopes, δ15N), whereas measures of foraging habitat (using carbon stable isotopes, δ13C) were not significant. Mercury concentrations were above the regulatory guidelines for fish health effects and safe human consumption for 88% and 70% of species, respectively, suggesting on-going cause for concern for shark health, and human consumers of shark meat.",Carbon | Elasmobranch | Isotopes | Length | Nitrogen | South Africa | Trophic position,11,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Song overlapping, a behaviour in which an individual begins singing before its counterpart has completed its song, has been the subject of recent debate. Although many studies have suggested that song overlapping functions as a signal, the majority of these studies fail to address the possibility that overlapping is a chance occurrence. Part of the difficulty in determining whether overlap is intentional or accidental lies in the lack of compelling null models for estimating chance levels of song overlap. We have developed the Song Overlap Null model Generator (SONG), a software package for R. SONG uses resampling randomization to predict the expected amount of overlap due to chance, and is applicable to any system in which individuals engage in signalling interactions. To evaluate the effectiveness of SONG, we examined the overlapping behaviour of three avian species: black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus), rufous-and-white wrens (Thryophilus rufalbus) and long-tailed manakins (Chiroxiphia linearis). Our analyses revealed that black-capped chickadees avoided overlapping the songs of playback-simulated intruders, duetting wrens overlapped the songs of their mates and manakins avoided overlapping the duets of their neighbours. We believe that SONG will prove to be a valuable tool for understanding signal timing in songbirds as well as other taxa.",Animal communication | birdsong | signal timing | song overlapping | vocal interaction,9,0,NSF,1148867,National Science Foundation

Post-copulatory processes, including sperm competition and cryptic female choice (CFC), can play important roles in the maintenance of polymorphisms. In Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), color morphs (red and white) exist due to genetic polymorphisms affecting carotenoid deposition in flesh, skin, and gametes. We investigated the role of post-spawning sexual selection in maintaining the polymorphism in a mixed population. First, we compared sperm velocity differences in water between morphs. Next, we measured color-based CFC via 2 methods: 1) sperm velocity in ovarian fluid and 2) in vitro competitive fertilization using paired red and white males. We found that red males had marginally faster sperm relative to white males in water, suggesting that carotenoid storage may affect sperm performance. However, ovarian fluid of red and white females influenced sperm velocity of red and white males differently, indicative of color-based CFC on sperm velocity. Furthermore, we found evidence of color-based CFC on paternity success during in vitro competitive fertilizations; however, sperm velocity in ovarian fluid did not predict results found under in vitro fertilization. Instead, in our study, sperm velocity in water was a significant predictor of fertilization success. When we accounted for this difference in sperm velocity (in water) between paired males, we partitioned the amount of variation in fertilization success that was attributed to individual level CFC (male pair × female) and male competitiveness (male pair) as 43% and 16%, respectively. In conclusion, post-spawning sexual selection processes represent important mechanisms contributing to the maintenance of the color polymorphism in nature.",Carotenoids | Color polymorphism | Competitive fertilization | Cryptic female choice | Ovarian fluid | Sperm competition,9,1,,61740,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

This study collected multiple age classes of lake trout from Lake Huron's Main Basin, Georgian Bay, and North Channel regions to compare and contrast top predator polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) bioaccumulation patterns in separate compartments of the same ecosystem. Sum PCB concentrations were highest for Main Basin (260±24.9ngg-1 wet wt) fish, followed by Georgian Bay (74.6±16.2ngg-1) and North Channel (42.0±3.3ngg-1) fish. Discriminant functions analysis of lake trout PCB profiles and stable carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope values clearly distinguished fish by location, indicating high degrees of basin fidelity throughout their lifetimes in addition to highly contrasting PCB bioaccumulation profiles. These unique profiles were not attributable to significant differences in lake trout lipid contents (p=0.856) or trophic position (δ15N; p=0.334), with rainbow smelt representing the primary prey across the basins. Furthermore, significant differences were observed among the basins for the relationships between PCB biomagnification factors and hydrophobicity. An empirical model for predicting PCB biomagnification in Lake Huron lake trout indicated that basin-specific population growth rates and prey abundances were significant for explaining these contrasting patterns of PCB bioaccumulation.

SMRs were significantly higher (26%) in fish from the contaminated area during acute trials. Both populations showed large decreases in SMR (49% to 52%) following clearance; however, differences between populations were still evident. There were no significant differences in SMRs between populations for F1 fish.

Recent research in the emerging field of epigenetics has implications with the potential to re-ignite acrimony in the discourse of reproductive rights, medical ethics, and the role of the state in our homes and in our lives. For scientists, epigenetics has profoundly realigned our understanding of heredity: epigenetics provides a mechanism through which the environmental challenges met in one generation can be inscribed and transmitted to future offspring. Although both genetic parents have the potential to transmit heritable epigenetic changes to their offspring, mothers have a particularly potent effect because nutrition in the uterine environment can exert a supplemental effect upon the epigenetic imprint of her offspring, and potentially, upon subsequent generations. Moreover, parental care post partum may have generational consequences that are more than just social. Unless discussants have a nuanced understanding of basic epigenetics, women could suffer a disproportionate burden of the obligation to promote fetal, neonatal, and trans-generational health. Drawing upon past patterns of discourse, ethics, and legislation in reproductive rights, I list some of the challenges and temptations that we will be facing at the individual, familial, social, and legislative levels.",Diet | Environmental justice | Epigenetics | Ethics | Health costs | Heredity | Law | Reproductive politics | Social justice,0,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Examination of fish responses to sound stimuli has a rich and varied history but it is not always clear when responses are true measures of hearing or the lateral-line. The central innervation of auditory and lateral-line sensory afferents lie in close proximity in the brainstem and both sets of receptors are, at heart, hair cell-based particle motion detectors. While it is possible to separately measure physiological activity of these two receptor subtypes, many studies of fish “hearing” use whole brain potentials or behavioural assays in complex sound fields where it is not possible to distinguish inputs. We argue here that, as often measured, what is thought of as fish “hearing” is often a multisensory response of both auditory and lateral line receptors. We also argue that in many situations where fish use sound stimuli, the behaviour is also an integrative response of both systems, due to the often close proximity of fish during sound communication. We end with a set of recommendations for better understanding the separate and combined roles of ear and lateral-line hair cells as well as an acknowledgment of the seminal and continuing contributions of Arthur N.

The objective of this study was to determine the lower temperature threshold for black soldier fly development. Development time, egg eclosion and adult emergence success were measured at 12, 16 and 19 °C. We determined that the lower threshold for egg hatch was between 12 and 16 °C, taking 15 days to hatch.

Caves and associated subterranean habitats represent some of the harshest environments on Earth, yet many organisms, including fishes, have colonized and thrive in these habitats despite the complete absence of light, and other abiotic and biotic constraints. Over 170 species of fishes are considered obligate subterranean inhabitants (stygobionts) that exhibit some degree of troglomorphy, including degeneration of eyes and reduction in pigmentation. To compensate for lack of vision, many species have evolved constructive changes to non-visual sensory modalities. In this chapter we review hearing in cavefishes, with particular emphasize on our own studies on amblyopsid cavefishes. Hearing in cavefishes has not been well studied to date, as hearing ability has only been examined in four species. Two species show no differences in hearing ability relative to their surface relatives, while the other two species (family Amblyopsidae) exhibit regression in the form of reduced hearing range and reduction in hair cell densities on sensory epithelia. In addition to reviewing our current knowledge on cavefish hearing, we offer suggestions for future avenues of research on cavefish hearing and discuss the influence of Popper and Fay on the field of cavefish bioacoustics.",Acoustic | Auditory | Evolution | Fish | Subterranean,0,0,,undefined,

Families of cyclin-like proteins have emerged that bind and activate cyclin dependent kinases (Cdk)s, directing the phosphorylation of noncanonical Cdk substrates. One of these proteins, Spy1, has demonstrated the unique ability to directly bind and activate both Cdk1 and Cdk2, as well as binding and promoting the degradation of at least one Cdk inhibitor, p27Kip1. Spy1 accelerates somatic cell growth and proliferation and is implicated in a number of human cancers including the breast, brain and liver. Herein we isolate key residues mediating the direct interaction with p27. We use mutants of Spy1 to determine the physiological role of direct interactions with distinct binding partners Cdk2 and p27. We demonstrate that disrupting the direct interaction with either Spy1 binding partner decreased endogenous activity of Cdk2, as well as Spy1-mediated proliferation. However, only the direct interaction with p27 was essential for Spy1-mediated effects on p27 stability. In vivo neither mutation completely prevented tumorigenesis, although each mutation slowed the rate of Spy1-mediated tumorigenesis and decreased overall tumor volumes. This work supports the conclusion that direct interaction with both p27 and Cdk2 contribute to Spy1-mediated effects on cell growth. It is important to elucidate the dynamics of these interactions and to consider these data when assessing functional outcomes.",Cell cycle | Cell growth | RINGO | Senescence | Tumorigenesis,8,1,CBCRA,CCS,Canadian Cancer Society

Here, we investigate the role of Securin, Separase and the cohesin complex in female meiosis using fluorescence in situ hybridization against centromeric and arm-specific sequences to monitor cohesion. We show that Securin destruction and Separase activity are required for timely release of arm cohesion in anaphase I and centromere-proximal cohesion in anaphase II. They are also required for release of arm cohesion on polar body chromosomes. Cohesion on polar body chromosomes depends on the cohesin components SMC3 and the mitotic a-kleisin Rad21 (also called Vtd in Drosophila). We provide cytological evidence that SMC3 is required for arm cohesion in female meiosis, whereas Rad21, in agreement with recent findings, is not.

Embryos of the brine shrimp, Artemia franciscana, are genetically programmed to develop either ovoviparously or oviparously depending on environmental conditions. Shortly upon their release from the female, oviparous embryos enter diapause during which time they undergo major metabolic rate depression while simultaneously synthesize proteins that permit them to tolerate a wide range of stressful environmental events including prolonged periods of desiccation, freezing, and anoxia. Among the known stress-related proteins that accumulate in embryos entering diapause are the late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins. This large group of intrinsically disordered proteins has been proposed to act as molecular shields or chaperones of macromolecules which are otherwise intolerant to harsh conditions associated with diapause. In this research, we used two model systems to study the potential function of the group 1 LEA proteins from Artemia. Expression of the Artemia group 1 gene (AfrLEA-1) in Escherichia coli inhibited growth in proportion to the number of 20-mer amino acid motifs expressed. As well, clones of E. coli, transformed with the AfrLEA-1 gene, expressed multiple bands of LEA proteins, either intrinsically or upon induction with isopropyl-β-thiogalactoside (IPTG), in a vector-specific manner. Expression of AfrLEA-1 in E. coli did not overcome the inhibitory effects of high concentrations of NaCl and KCl but modulated growth inhibition resulting from high concentrations of sorbitol in the growth medium. In contrast, expression of the AfrLEA-1 gene in Saccharomyces cerevisiae did not alter the growth kinetics or permit yeast to tolerate high concentrations of NaCl, KCl, or sorbitol. However, expression of AfrLEA-1 in yeast improved its tolerance to drying (desiccation) and freezing. Under our experimental conditions, both E. coli and S. cerevisiae appear to be potentially suitable hosts to study the function of Artemia group 1 LEA proteins under environmentally stressful conditions.",Artemia | E. coli | Late embryogenesis abundant | LEA proteins | S. cerevisiae,3,0,,undefined,

Sex biases in distributions of migratory birds during the non-breeding season are widespread; however, the proximate mechanisms contributing to broad-scale sex-ratio variation are not well understood. We analyzed a long-term winter-banding dataset in combination with spring migration data from individuals tracked by using geolocators to test three hypotheses for observed variation in sex-ratios in wintering flocks of snow buntings Plectrophenax nivalis. We quantified relevant weather conditions in winter (temperature, snowfall and snow depth) at each banding site each year and measured body size and condition (fat scores) of individual birds (n > 5500). We also directly measured spring migration distance for 17 individuals by using light-level geolocators. If the distribution pattern of birds in winter is related to interactions between individual body size and thermoregulation, then larger bodied birds (males) should be found in colder sites (body size hypothesis). Males may also winter closer to breeding grounds to reduce migration distance for early arrival at breeding sites (arrival timing hypothesis). Finally, males may be socially dominant over females, and thus exclude females from high-quality wintering sites (social dominance hypothesis). We found support for the body size hypothesis, in that colder and snowier weather predicted both larger body size and higher proportions of males banded. Direct tracking revealed that males did not winter significantly closer to their breeding site, despite being slightly further north on average than females from the same breeding population. We found some evidence for social dominance, in that females tended to carry more fat than males, potentially indicating lower habitat quality for females. Global climatic warming may reduce temperature constraints on females and smaller-bodied males, resulting in broad-scale changes in distributional patterns.

Experimental glucocorticoid (GC) manipulations can be useful for identifying the mechanisms that drive life-history and fitness variation in free-living animals, but predicting the effects of GC treatment can be complicated. Much of the uncertainty stems from the multi-faceted role of GCs in organismal metabolism, and their variable influence with respect to life-history stage, ecological context, age, sex and individual variation. Glucocorticoid hormones have been implicated in the regulation of parental care in many vertebrate taxa but in two seemingly contradictory ways, which sets up a potential GC-induced 'reproductive conflict'. Circulating GCs mediate adaptive physiological and behavioural responses to stressful events, and elevated levels can lead to trade offs between reproductive effort and survival (e.g. the current reproduction vs. survival hypothesis). The majority of studies examining the fitness effects of GC manipulations extend from this hypothesis. However, when animals are not stressed (likely most of the time) baseline GCs act as key metabolic regulators of daily energy balance, homoeostasis, osmoregulation and food acquisition, with pleiotropic effects on locomotor activity or foraging behaviour. Slight increases in circulating baseline levels can then have positive effects on reproductive effort (e.g. the 'cort' fitness/adaptation hypotheses), but comparatively few GC manipulation studies have targeted these small, non-stress induced increases. We review studies of GC manipulations and examine the specific hypotheses used to predict the effects of manipulations in wild, breeding vertebrates. We argue that given the dichotomous function of GCs the current 'reproduction vs. survival' paradigm is unnecessarily restrictive and predicts only deleterious GC effects on fitness. Therefore, a broader set of hypotheses should be considered when testing the fitness effects of GC manipulations. When framing experimental manipulation studies, we urge researchers to consider three key points: life-history context (e.g. long vs. short lived, semelparous vs. iteroparous, etc.), ecological context and dose delivery.",Baseline levels | Corticosterone | Cortisol | Fitness | Glucocorticoids | Implants,45,0,,undefined,

Here, we examine the specific requirements for the three mitotic cyclins, A, B, and B3 in meiosis of Drosophila melanogaster. We find that all three cyclins contribute redundantly to nuclear envelope breakdown, though cyclin A appears to make the most important individual contribution. Cyclin A is also required for biorientation of homologs in meiosis I. Cyclin B3, as previously reported, is required for anaphase progression in meiosis I and in meiosis II. We find that it also plays a redundant role, with cyclin A, in preventing DNA replication during meiosis. Cyclin B is required for maintenance of the metaphase I arrest in mature oocytes, for spindle organization, and for timely progression through the second meiotic division. It is also essential for polar body formation at the completion of meiosis. With the exception of its redundant role in meiotic maturation, cyclin B appears to function independently of cyclins A and B3 through most of meiosis.

Naphthenic acids (NAs) are persistent compounds that are components of most petroleum, including those found in the Athabasca oil sands. Their presence in freshly processed tailings is of significant environmental concern due to their toxicity to aquatic organisms. Gamma irradiation (GI) was used to reduce the toxicity and concentration of NAs in oil sands process water (OSPW) and fluid fine tailings (FFT). This investigation systematically studied the impact of GI on the biogeochemical development and progressive reduction of toxicity using laboratory incubations of fresh and aged tailings under anoxic and oxic conditions. GI reduced NA concentrations in OSPW by up to 97% in OSPW and in FFT by 85%. The GI-treated FFT exhibited increased rates of biogeochemical change, dependent on the age of the tailings source. Dissolved oxygen (DO) flux was enhanced in GI-treated FFT from fresh and aged source materials, whereas hydrogen sulfide (HS-) flux was stimulated only in the fresh FFT. Acute toxicity to Vibrio fischeri was immediately reduced following GI treatment of fresh OSPW. GI treatment followed by 4-week incubation reduced toxicity of aged OSPW to V. fischeri.",Gamma irradiation treatment | Microbial respiration rates | Naphthenic acids | Oil industry pollution | Oil sands process water | Toxicity,11,0,,812221,Total

Human activities are altering the processes that connect organisms within and among habitats and populations in marine and freshwater (aquatic) ecosystems. Connectivity can be quantified using graph theory, where habitats or populations are represented by 'nodes' and dispersal is represented by 'links'. This approach spans discipline and systemic divides, facilitating identification of generalities in human impacts. We conducted a review of studies that have used graph theory to quantify spatial functional connectivity in aquatic ecosystems. The search identified 42 studies published in 2000-14. We assessed whether each study quantified the impacts of (1) habitat alteration (loss, alteration to links, and gain), (2) human movements causing species introductions, (3) overharvesting and (4) climate change (warming temperatures, altered circulation or hydrology, sea-level rise) and ocean acidification. In freshwater systems habitat alteration was the most commonly studied stressor, whereas in marine systems overharvesting, in terms of larval dispersal among protected areas, was most commonly addressed. Few studies have directly assessed effects of climate change, suggesting an important area of future research. Graph representations of connectivity revealed similarities across different impacts and systems, suggesting common strategies for conservation management. We suggest future research directions for studies of aquatic connectivity to inform conservation management of aquatic ecosystems.

For example, trace elements such as mercury (Hg) and lead (Pb) alter biochemical processes within wildlife that may affect migration and breeding. While there is a growing understanding of how contaminants may influence wildlife physiology, studies addressing these interactions in free-living species are still limited. We examined how four non-essential trace elements (cadmium, Hg, Pb and selenium) interacted with physiological and breeding measures known to influence breeding in a free-living population of common eider ducks (Somateria mollissima). We collected blood from female eiders as they arrived at a breeding colony in northern Canada. Blood was subsequently assessed for baseline corticosterone (CORT), immunoglobulin Y (IgY), and the four trace elements. We used model selection to identify which elements varied most with CORT, IgY, arrival condition, and arrival timing. We then used path analysis to assess how the top two elements from the model selection process (Hg and Pb) varied with metrics known to influence reproduction. We found that arrival date, blood Hg, CORT, and IgY showed significant inter-annual variation. While blood Pb concentrations were low, blood Pb levels significantly increased with later arrival date of the birds, and varied negatively with eider body condition, suggesting that even at low blood concentrations, Pb may be related to lower investment in reproduction in eiders. In contrast, blood Hg concentrations were positively correlated with eider body condition, indicating that fatter birds also had higher Hg burdens. Overall, our results suggest that although blood Hg and Pb concentrations were below no-effect levels, these low level concentrations of known toxic metals show significant relationships with breeding onset and condition in female eider ducks, factors that could influence reproductive success in this species.",Arctic | Cumulative effects | Endocrine system | Hormones | Immunity | Marine birds,18,0,NSERC,2015-2016-M-24,University of Windsor

Woodford et al. The Anthropocene Epoch is characterized by novel and increasingly complex dependencies between the environment and human civilization, with many challenges of biodiversity management emerging as wicked problems. Problems arising from the management of biological invasions can be either tame (with simple or obvious solutions) or wicked, where difficulty in appropriately defining the problem can make complete solutions impossible to find. We review four case studies that reflect the main goals in the management of biological invasions - prevention, eradication, and impact reduction - assessing the drivers and extent of wickedness in each. We find that a disconnect between the perception and reality of how wicked a problem is can profoundly influence the likelihood of successful management. For example, managing species introductions can be wicked, but shifting from species-focused to vector-focused risk management can greatly reduce the complexity, making it a tame problem. The scope and scale of the overall management goal will also dictate the wickedness of the problem and the achievability of management solutions (cf. eradication and ecosystem restoration). Finally, managing species that have both positive and negative impacts requires engagement with all stakeholders and scenario-based planning. Effective management of invasions requires either recognizing unavoidable wickedness, or circumventing it by seeking alternative management perspectives.",Conflict species | Invasive species | Stakeholder engagement,41,1,,DMR,National Kidney Foundation of South Africa

The potential benefits of physiology for conservation are well established and include greater specificity of management techniques, determination of cause-effect relationships, increased sensitivity of health and disturbance monitoring and greater capacity for predicting future change. While descriptions of the specific avenues in which conservation and physiology can be integrated are readily available and important to the continuing expansion of the discipline of 'conservation physiology', to date there has been no assessment of how the field has specifically contributed to conservation success. However, the goal of conservation physiology is to foster conservation solutions and it is therefore important to assess whether physiological approaches contribute to downstream conservation outcomes and management decisions. Here, we present eight areas of conservation concern, ranging from chemical contamination to invasive species to ecotourism, where physiological approaches have led to beneficial changes in human behaviour, management or policy. We also discuss the shared characteristics of these successes, identifying emerging themes in the discipline. Specifically, we conclude that conservation physiology: (i) goes beyond documenting change to provide solutions; (ii) offers a diversity of physiological metrics beyond glucocorticoids (stress hormones); (iii) includes approaches that are transferable among species, locations and times; (iv) simultaneously allows for human use and benefits to wildlife; and (v) is characterized by successes that can be difficult to find in the primary literature. Overall, we submit that the field of conservation physiology has a strong foundation of achievements characterized by a diversity of conservation issues, taxa, physiological traits, ecosystem types and spatial scales. We hope that these concrete successes will encourage the continued evolution and use of physiological tools within conservation-based research and management plans.",Conservation physiology | Ecotourism | Invasive species | Nutrition | Sensory ecology | Toxicology,18,1,,BCS-1134687,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

Many animals breed in large mating aggregations, where males must rapidly discriminate between prospective mates and rivals. Selection may favour features that facilitate rapid discrimination in these aggregations. The explosively breeding Neotropical Yellow Toad, Incilius luetkenii, exhibits a rapid and dramatic colour change; males change from a cryptic brown to a conspicuous lemon yellow for their brief breeding period. Females, in contrast, remain cryptic brown throughout the year. The function of this temporary, sex-specific colour change is unknown. We tested the hypothesis that yellow colouration displayed by male I. luetkenii facilitates sex recognition during both daytime and nighttime mating aggregations. We created yellow and brown model toads and presented them to males during a breeding event. Male I. luetkenii responded significantly more intensely to brown models compared to yellow models, approaching them and making more amplexus attempts on the brown versus yellow models. This strong pattern held true regardless of ambient light intensity, making this the first study to expose a dynamic colour signal that operates during both day and night. Our results indicate that male I. luetkenii use colouration to quickly discriminate between males and females during their brief, explosive mating aggregations. Our findings suggest that the rapid, dramatic colour change of male I. luetkenii facilitates sex recognition, which could provide a significant fitness advantage to males in the form of reduced energy expenditure and reduced risk of injury by other males.

Stress hormones (i.e., glucocorticoids such as corticosterone and cortisol) have been widely proposed as biomarkers of habitat quality and disturbance. However, there is growing evidence that baseline glucocorticoid (GC) levels are highly context-dependent, potentially confounding their utility for inferring population-level disturbance depending on the life history stage and the duration, severity, and type of environmental change being measured. Determining which aspects of an organism's environment are consistently reflected by baseline GC levels is therefore of paramount importance to establishing how they may be best suited to conservation monitoring goals. We investigated the relationship between baseline GC levels and three extrinsic (food availability, inter-specific nest competition, intra-specific competition) and two intrinsic (reproductive investment, body condition) environmental contexts in breeding female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor) at two reproductive stages. We combined this with a manipulation of energetic demand (i.e., a decrease in foraging profitability) to determine whether baseline GCs reflect the extrinsic or intrinsic environment when females are faced with an unexpected disturbance. Baseline GC levels were not reflective of any environmental component in control females, regardless of reproductive stage. However, levels increased and were reflective of a decrease in body mass when females were challenged during the offspring provisioning period. Our findings suggest that baseline GCs may not always be indicative of the environmental contexts we associate with variation in habitat quality, particularly when individuals are operating within their expected energetic demand. In a conservation sense, baseline GCs may be more valuable in reflecting unexpected perturbations, which could limit their applicability as sensitive, predictive biomarkers across a diversity of systems.",Biomarker | Conservation physiology | Corticosterone | Environmental quality | Glucocorticoid | Stress hormone,14,0,,29401,Canada Foundation for Innovation

During the past three decades, coastal marine waters have become among the most invaded habitats globally. Ascidians are among the most notorious invaders in these ecosystems. Owing to their rapid spread, frequent population outbreaks, and associated negative ecological and economic impacts, invasive ascidians have become a global problem. Thus, the study of ascidian invasions has become a prominent area of invasion biology. Here, we review current knowledge and conclude that ascidians are good models for studying invasion success in the marine realm. Firstly, we summarize the reconstruction of invasion pathways or colonization histories and associated negative impacts of invasive ascidians, and address the urgent need to clarify ambiguous taxonomy of ascidians. Secondly, we discuss factors that underlie or facilitate invasion success of ascidians, including vectors of introduction and spread, environmental changes, biological traits, and possible genetic issues. Finally, we summarize current science-based policies and management solutions that are in place to prevent and control spread of invasive ascidians. We conclude by highlighting key research questions that remain to be answered, and propose future research to investigate mechanisms of invasion success in the marine realm using ascidians as model systems.",,54,0,CAS,31272665,Chinese Academy of Sciences

Mirex, historically used as a pesticide and fire retardant, was released to Lake Ontario during the 1960s. Even after 35-40. years of cessation of its production and bans on use during the 1970s, mirex is considered a contaminant of concern. In this study, we present a comprehensive view of long-term trends and significance of mirex/photomirex levels in fish from the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes. Majority of measurements (except for Lake Ontario) were below detection, especially in recent years. Concentrations of mirex in Lake Ontario fish decreased by approximately 90% between 1975-2010, and both mirex and photomirex decreased by 75% between 1993-2010. Half-lives of mirex and photomirex for the entire period ranged from 4-10. years, but were lower at 2.5-8. years in recent times indicating expedited recovery possibly in response to remedial actions performed in the 1990s. Simulated fish consumption advisories generated by considering only mirex and photomirex indicated that mirex/photomirex is a minor concern. We predict that within 15. years mirex/photomirex levels in Lake Ontario fish will drop to levels that will result in advisories of at least 8. meals/month. In either case, the presence of other contaminants in Lake Ontario fish contributes to more stringent advisory than generated by mirex/photomirex. It is recommended that the routine monitoring of mirex/photomirex be replaced with periodic surveillance to reduce analytical costs.

The evasion of anti-growth signaling is an important characteristic of cancer cells. In order to continue to proliferate, cancer cells must somehow uncouple themselves from the many signals that exist to slow down cell growth. Here, we define the anti-growth signaling process, and review several important pathways involved in growth signaling: p53, phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), retinoblastoma protein (Rb), Hippo, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), AT-rich interactive domain 1A (ARID1A), Notch, insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and Krüppel-like factor 5 (KLF5) pathways. Aberrations in these processes in cancer cells involve mutations and thus the suppression of genes that prevent growth, as well as mutation and activation of genes involved in driving cell growth. Using these pathways as examples, we prioritize molecular targets that might be leveraged to promote anti-growth signaling in cancer cells. Interestingly, naturally occurring phytochemicals found in human diets (either singly or as mixtures) may promote anti-growth signaling, and do so without the potentially adverse effects associated with synthetic chemicals. We review examples of naturally occurring phytochemicals that may be applied to prevent cancer by antagonizing growth signaling, and propose one phytochemical for each pathway. These are: epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG) for the Rb pathway, luteolin for p53, curcumin for PTEN, porphyrins for Hippo, genistein for GDF15, resveratrol for ARID1A, withaferin A for Notch and diguelin for the IGF1-receptor pathway. The coordination of anti-growth signaling and natural compound studies will provide insight into the future application of these compounds in the clinical setting.",Anti-growth signaling | Cancer prevention | Hallmark of cancer | Reversible and irreversible evasion | Tumor suppressor,33,1,,undefined,

Alien invasive species (AIS) have received much attention for their harmful effects on health, ecology and the global economy. In response to this threat, many countries have adopted the Convention on Biological Diversity, which requires prevention or eradication of AIS. The best management approach is prevention, however when this fails and AIS establish, it is imperative that cost-efficient, rapid-response (RR) countermeasures be available. We performed a meta-analysis of case studies involving successful and failed RR to AIS in temperate aquatic ecosystems. We examined eight variables including ecosystem type (freshwater vs. marine), method type (chemical vs. mechanical), number of methods (multiple vs. single), taxonomy (animal vs. plant), population abundance (number of organisms), infestation extent (surface area of infestation), habitat size (surface area of management site), and project duration (length of project in number of months). Eradication success was significantly greater for plant (89 %) versus animal AIS (64 %) while suppression of AIS was most successful for projects using chemical versus mechanical methods and when conducted in small habitats. Managers should expect that taxonomy will be highly influential to the success of eradication-based RR, while both method type and management surface area influence suppression outcomes.",Aquatic alien invasive species | Eradication | Management | Meta-analysis | Rapid response | Suppression,12,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Many countries/areas are experiencing or may soon experience water scarcity owing to rapid population growth, urbanization and/or climate change. Currently, almost one-fifth of the world’s population (1.2 billion) live in areas of physical water scarcity. Water diversions have become a commonplace solution proposed by governments for alleviation of physical water scarcity. Thus far, more than 80 major projects are completed or under construction globally, including the world’s largest diversion: South-to-North Water Transfer Project (SNWTP) in China. Negative effects associated with water diversions, such as habitat loss and transfer of pollutants, have been recognized. However, it has been largely overlooked that “invasion highways” are created when water diversions link biogeographic regions. These “invasion highways” can facilitate spread of an array of non-native species. Although previous experiences have provided clear warnings regarding spread of non-native invasive species through artificial waterways, these lessons have been largely ignored by governments when resolving water scarcity problems. Here we use SNWTP, which will likely facilitate spread of invasive golden mussels, as well as many known examples of non-native invasive species spread through artificial waterways in other water systems, to call on governments to formally establish policy and seek management solutions to considering spread of non-native species when planning water diversions.",Golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei | Invasive species | Water scarcity | Water transfer,8,0,NSERC,31272665,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Chemical cues and pheromones guide decisions in organisms throughout the animal kingdom. The neurobiology, function, and evolution of olfaction are particularly well described in insects, and resulting concepts have driven novel approaches to pest control. However, aside from several exceptions, the olfactory biology of vertebrates remains poorly understood. One exception is the sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), which relies heavily upon olfaction during reproduction. Here, we provide a broad review of the chemical cues and pheromones used by the sea lamprey during reproduction, including overviews of the sea lamprey olfactory system, chemical cues and pheromones, and potential applications to population management. The critical role of olfaction in mediating the sea lamprey life cycle is evident by a well-developed olfactory system. Sea lamprey use chemical cues and pheromones to identify productive spawning habitat, coordinate spawning behaviors, and avoid risk. Manipulation of olfactory biology offers opportunities for management of populations in the Laurentian Great Lakes, where the sea lamprey is a destructive invader. We suggest that the sea lamprey is a broadly useful organism with which to study vertebrate olfaction because of its simple but well-developed olfactory organ, the dominant role of olfaction in guiding behaviors during reproduction, and the direct implications for vertebrate pest management.",Chemical communication | Integrated pest management | Olfaction | Sensory biology,23,1,,undefined,

Measuring in situ nutrient and energy flows in spatially and temporally complex aquatic ecosystems represents a major ecological challenge. Food web structure, energy and nutrient budgets are difficult to measure, and it is becoming more important to quantify both energy and nutrient flow to determine how food web processes and structure are being modified by multiple stressors. We propose that polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congeners represent an ideal tracer to quantify in situ energy and nutrient flow between trophic levels. Here, we demonstrate how an understanding of PCB congener bioaccumulation dynamics provides multiple direct measurements of energy and nutrient flow in aquatic food webs. To demonstrate this novel approach, we quantified nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P) and caloric turnover rates for Lake Huron lake trout, and reveal how these processes are regulated by both growth rate and fish life history. Although minimal nutrient recycling was observed in young growing fish, slow growing, older lake trout (>5 yr) recycled an average of 482 Tonnes·yr -1 of N, 45 Tonnes·yr -1 of P and assimilated 22 TJ yr -1 of energy. Compared to total P loading rates of 590 Tonnes·yr -1 , the recycling of primarily bioavailable nutrients by fish plays an important role regulating the nutrient states of oligotrophic lakes.",,5,0,,undefined,

Chemotherapy agents like paclitaxel are often a first line of therapy for triple-negative breast cancer patients and a last line of therapy for other aggressive breast cancers. While such agents are effective pro-apoptotic treatments for breast cancer cells, they produce many unwanted side effects. Synthetic glucocorticoids like dexamethasone are commonly prescribed during chemotherapy treatment of breast cancer patients for anti-emetic and anti-hypersensitivity purposes. Dexamethasone, however, is known to enhance cell survival in solid tumors. The prevalent use of dexamethasone in conjunction with paclitaxel in the treatment of breast cancer patients merits concern. Previous studies demonstrate dexamethasone-mediated survival in a subset of breast cancer cells in the presence of paclitaxel. This work expanded the types of cell lines studied and explored the molecular mechanism driving this phenotype. Human breast cancer cell lines representative of several subtypes of breast cancer including triple-negative breast cancer, luminal, and HER2 were treated in the presence and absence of paclitaxel, dexamethasone, and under co-treatment conditions. Cell survival was monitored under differing conditions. We then manipulated aspects of the nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) signaling pathway to elucidate the importance of this pathway in overcoming chemotherapy treatment. All cell lines tested were sensitive to paclitaxel and showed dexamethasone-mediated rescue from paclitaxel-induced apoptosis, but the rescue of overall cell numbers was most pronounced in triple-negative breast cancer cell lines. Dexamethasone and paclitaxel inversely regulated the activity of NFkappaB, which is essential to both paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis and dexamethasone-mediated rescue. The transcriptional target of NFkappaB, Fas receptor, is inversely regulated by paclitaxel and dexamethasone and is a downstream target of paclitaxel-activated NFkappaB. Dexamethasone antagonizes paclitaxel-mediated apoptosis through inhibition of NFkappaB transcription of Fas receptor. Pre-treatment of breast cancer patients with dexamethasone may greatly reduce patient response to paclitaxel. Our study elucidates a novel mechanism of paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in breast cancer cell lines and explicates dexamethasone’s antagonism of paclitaxel.",Apoptosis | Breast cancer | Chemotherapy | NFκB | Steroids,2,0,,undefined,

Accurate diagnosis of the specific subtypes of this disease is vital to ensure that patients will have the best possible response to therapy. One way to discriminate subtypes of breast cancer is to study those genes that differentially express across different subtypes. In this study, we use different machine learning techniques to select the most informative genes corresponding to ten subtypes of breast cancer. In particular, we propose a new bottom-up hierarchical classification approach to select the most informative genes for different subtypes, while we identify the similarity level between these subtypes. Our results support that this new approach to gene selection yields a small subset of genes that can predict each of these ten subtypes with very high accuracy. Moreover, the proposed model provides an insightful structure for further analysis of these subtypes.",breast cancer | gene expression | hierarchical classification | subtype,3,0,,undefined,

Background: Prostate cancer is complicated by a high level of unexplained variability in the aggressiveness of newly diagnosed disease. Given that this is one of the most prevalent cancers worldwide, finding biomarkers to effectively stratify high risk patient populations is a vital next step in improving survival rates and quality of life after treatment. Materials and Methods: In this study, we selected a dataset consisting of 106 prostate cancer samples, which represent various stages of prostate cancer and developed by RNA-Seq technology. Our objective is to identify differentially expressed transcripts associated with prostate cancer progression using pair-wise stage comparisons. Results: Using machine learning techniques, we identified 44 transcripts that are correlated to different stages of progression. Expression of an identified transcript, USP13, is reduced in stage T3 in comparison with stage T2c, a pattern also observed in breast cancer tumourigenesis. We also identified another differentially expressed transcript, PTGFR, which has also been reported to be involved in prostate cancer progression and has also been linked to breast, ovarian and renal cancers. Conclusions: The results support the use of RNA-Seq along with machine learning techniques as an essential tool in identifying potential biomarkers for prostate cancer progression. Further studies elucidating the biochemical role of identified transcripts in vitro are crucial in validating the use of these biomarkers in the prediction of disease progression and development of effective therapeutic strategies.",Alternative Splicing | Classification | Feature Selection | Machine Learning | Next Generation Sequencing | Prostate Cancer,6,0,,undefined,

By combining microsatellite and age information from larval yellow perch (Perca flavescens) collected in the Lake St. Clair-Detroit River system (SC-DRS) and western Lake Erie with a hydrodynamic backtracking approach, we quantified subpopulation structure, connectivity, and contributions of recruits to the juvenile stage in western Lake Erie during 2006-2007. After finding weak (yet stable) genetic structure between the SC-DRS and two western Lake Erie subpopulations, microsatellites also revealed measurable recruitment of SC-DRS larvae to the juvenile stage in western Lake Erie (17%-21% during 2006-2007). Consideration of precollection larval dispersal trajectories, using hydrodynamic backtracking, increased estimated contributions to 65% in 2006 and 57% in 2007.

The majority of our knowledge about omnivores comes from studies examining their preferences for different species of plants and prey under different conditions. The potential effect of intraspecific variation in food quality on omnivore foraging behaviour has received less attention. To enhance our understanding of the foraging behaviour of omnivores, we used focal observations in the laboratory to monitor the foraging behaviour and activity budget of an omnivorous insect, Dicyphus hesperus Knight (Hemiptera: Miridae), in arenas where a single species of plant food and a single species of prey food were provided at varying levels of quality based on nitrogen content. The activity budget of D. hesperus was not balanced; it was dominated by prey feeding, followed by plant feeding and probing. Foraging behaviour of D. hesperus was affected by the interaction of prey and plant quality, such that optimal foraging theory could predict its foraging behaviour in the presence of prey reared on high N-fertilized tomato plants, but not in the presence of low N-fertilized tomato plants. Neither prey quality nor plant quality affected the rate of prey consumption or the handling time of prey by D. hesperus during the observation period. Our results highlight the complexity of omnivore feeding behaviour and indicate that feeding decisions are not based only on the prey or plant species provided, but also on the quality of those resources.",Activity budget | Dicyphus hesperus | Diet partitioning | Resource quality | Zoophytophagous omnivore,11,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

Fish were exposed to contaminated food containing PCBs and Hg to determine dietary chemical assimilation efficiencies (AEs) and elimination coefficients (k tot ). To test first-order kinetics, three exposure regimes were established by varying the proportion of contaminated fish incorporated into the food. Dietary AEs were 98 ± 10, 75 ± 12, and 40 ± 9% for MeHg, THg, and PCBs, respectively. The k tot values were 0.010 ± 0.003 and 0.010 ± 0.002 day -1 for THg and MeHg, respectively. No significant differences were found in k tot among the dosing levels for either THg or MeHg, confirming that Hg elimination is a first-order process. For PCB, k tot ranged from 0.007 to 0.022 day -1 and decreased with an increase in hydrophobicity. This study revealed that Hg had an AE higher than that of PCBs, while the k tot of Hg was similar to those measured for the most hydrophobic PCBs. We conclude that Hg has a bioaccumulation potential in goldfish 118% higher than the highest PCB BMF observed for congeners with a log K OW of >7.",,11,0,,undefined,

The geographic range of an invasive species is a key determinant of relative impact in the invaded region. Comparison of invasive species that are widespread or rare in invaded ranges can highlight mechanistic traits that determine the risk of impact from invasion. Round Goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is more geographically widespread and abundant than Tubenose Goby (Proterorhinus semilunaris) across invaded ranges of the Laurentian Great Lakes. We used stable isotopes of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) in liver and muscle to contrast the isotopic niche breadth and niche plasticity of Round Goby and Tubenose Goby near the inflow and outflow of Lake St. Clair and in western Lake Superior. At all sites, Round Goby and Tubenose Goby that matched in size (21–53 mm standard length) had distinct isotopic niches with no overlap, driven by higher δ15N in Round Goby. The variation in isotopic niche, and the mean difference in δ13C and δ15N between muscle and liver, was greater for Round Goby, suggesting both greater seasonal shifts in diet and niche plasticity in this more widely established invader. Round Goby that were significantly larger than Tubenose Goby had broader isotopic niches and greater niche plasticity in the majority of cases and this was associated with isotopic niche overlap with smaller Round Goby and Tubenose Goby. Our findings suggest that a broad and plastic isotopic niche provides scope for wider establishment range in invasive fish species.",Great Lakes | Isotopic niche | Niche plasticity | Round Goby | Tubenose Goby,20,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

The Acoustic Adaptation Hypothesis posits that habitat characteristics influence the structure of animal vocalizations and that animals will vocalize and display behaviours optimized for sound transmission. White-eared ground-sparrows Melozone leucotis live in habitats with dense vegetation where vocal communication is an ideal mode of communication for territory defence and mate attraction. On the basis of the Acoustic Adaptation Hypothesis, if solos and duets of these ground-sparrows are used in long-distance communication, we should expect that these vocalizations will exhibit structures that enhance sound transmission. We conducted a sound transmission experiment where we broadcast and re-recorded solo songs and duets to study their transmission properties. We used two speaker heights and two microphone heights to simulate different perch heights of signallers and receivers and four distances between the speakers and microphones to simulate variable distances of separation. We found that solo and duet songs show similar patterns of degradation and attenuation with distance and proximity to the ground. These results suggest that solo and duet songs facilitate communication with receivers at similar distances. The highest perches, for both signallers and receivers, maximized acoustic transmission. This is the first study that evaluates the transmission properties of songs and duets in birds, despite the fact that many bird species in tropical forests produce both types of vocalizations. To our surprise, we found that solo and duet songs degraded to below-detectable levels in less than a typical territory's diameter, suggesting that this species has not experienced strong selection for long-distance communication.",acoustic adaption | long-distance communication | Melozone leucotis | sound transmission | thicket habitats | white-eared ground-sparrow,6,0,,undefined,

Surficial (0-10cm) sediment from the western basin contained significantly greater (p<0.05) concentrations of ΣPCBs, ΣPBDEs and BPA than the other two basins.

To understand the effects of predator removal in marine ecosystems requires accurate estimates of trophic position and trophic structure that have been difficult to obtain to date. For example, most sharks are classified as diet generalists that feed around trophic position 4, but this classification contradicts observations of diverse feeding behaviour among large species, suggesting that trophic structure has been oversimplified among upper trophic level species. To test this assumption, bulk δ<sup>15</sup>N and δ<sup>13</sup>C values of 13 shark species constituting the large shark assemblage off southern Africa were integrated into (i) a hierarchical Bayesian model, accounting for body size and variable sample sizes among species, and (ii) a dietary δ<sup>15</sup>N-dependent enrichment model to quantify individual and assemblage-wide trophic position and structure. Compound specific isotopic analysis of amino acids (CSIA-AAs) for a subset of species was used to verify results. Although discrepancies occurred between methods, overall these data confirm that large sharks, including several globally threatened species, feed at markedly higher trophic positions and across a broader trophic range than is currently assumed. This identifies a lower degree of functional equivalence among the assemblage. Such complex trophic structure among large sharks suggests that cascading effects from species-specific removals in food webs may be weaker but more pervasive than currently assumed. Reassignment of the trophic structure of large marine predators has important consequences for any potential regulatory and stabilizing roles in marine food webs.",CSIA-AA | Elasmobranchs | Stable isotopes | Stomach contents | Trophic position,26,0,,undefined,

Trophic position and body mass are traits commonly used to predict organochlorine burdens. Sharks, however, have a variety of feeding and life history strategies and metabolize lipid uniquely. Because of this diversity, and the lipid-association of organochlorines, the dynamics of organochlorine accumulation in sharks may be predicted ineffectively by stable isotope-derived trophic position and body mass, as is typical for other taxa. The present study compared ontogenetic organochlorine profiles in the dusky shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) and white shark (Carcharodon carcharias), which differ in metabolic thermoregulation and trophic position throughout their ontogeny. Although greater organochlorine concentrations were observed in the larger bodied and higher trophic position white shark (e.g., p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene: 20.2 ± 2.7ng/g vs 9.3 ± 2.2ng/g in the dusky shark), slopes of growth-dilution corrected concentrations with age were equal to those of the dusky shark. Similar ontogenetic trophic position increases in both species, less frequent white shark seal predation than previously assumed, or inaccurate species-specific growth parameters are possible explanations. Inshore habitat use (indicated by δ13C values) and mass were important predictors in white and dusky sharks, respectively, of both overall compound profiles and select organochlorine concentrations. The present study clarified understanding of trophic position and body mass as reliable predictors of interspecific organochlorine accumulation in sharks, whereas regional endothermy and diet shifting were shown to have less impact on overall rates of accumulation.",Bioaccumulation | Dusky shark | Organochlorine | Stable isotopes | White shark,9,0,,undefined,

As urban sprawl and agricultural intensification continue to invade prime wildlife habitat, some animals, even apex predators, are managing to adapt to this new environment. Chemical pollution is one of many stressors that wildlife encounter in urban environments. Predators are particularly sensitive to persistent chemical pollutants because they feed at a high trophic level where such pollution is biomagnified. To examine levels of pollution in urban birds of prey in the Lower Mainland region of British Columbia, Canada, we analyzed persistent organic contaminants in adult birds found dead of trauma injury. The hepatic geometric mean concentration of sum polybrominated diphenyl ethers (∑PBDEs) in 13 Cooper's hawks (Accipiter cooperii) from Greater Vancouver was 1873ng/g (lipid weight) with one bird reaching 197,000ng/g lipid weight, the highest exposure reported to date for a wild bird. Concentrations of ∑PBDEs, ∑PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) and, surprisingly, cyclodiene insecticides were greatest in the urban environment while those of DDE (1,1-dichloroethylene bis[p-chlorophenyl) were highest in a region of intensive agriculture. The level of most chlorinated and brominated contaminants increased with trophic level (δ<sup>15</sup>N). The concentrations of some contaminants, PBDEs in particular, in these birds of prey may have some toxicological consequences.

Understanding the spatial context of genetic variation for species at risk is important for effective management and long-term survival of the species. We use multilocus microsatellite data to investigate the population genetic structure of the spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus) across its northern range edge in Canada. We then compare these northern individuals with samples taken from the southern core of the species range. For the northern samples, significant genetic differentiation among groups of individuals forming two major genetically distinct populations, and as many as 7–9 smaller subpopulations, was recovered using hierarchical Bayesian assignment methods and non-equilibrial discriminant function analyses. Spatial genetic variation is present, particularly at higher hierarchical groupings; however, some population admixture at sites is evident and is indicative of dispersal and gene flow among some locations or shared ancestry. Gene flow estimates among populations and subpopulations is very low, ranging from essentially complete isolation to as high as 5 %—suggesting that mechanisms in addition to geographic isolation are operating to create genetic structure. In Lake Erie, the physical isolation of Point Pelee appears to confer distinct genetic differentiation for those populations and provide a source of genetic variation for Lake Erie proper when breaches to the barrier beach occur. Results indicate that the northern edge populations are distinct from southern populations and should be conserved to maintain the overall genetic diversity of this species. Additionally, the asymmetrical genetic connectivity among the Point Pelee and Rondeau Bay sites highlights the sensitivity of Point Pelee to environmental perturbation and habitat degradation.",Edge population | Genetic structure | Microsatellite | Spotted gar,3,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

The polo-like kinases are a family of conserved serine/threonine kinases that play multiple roles in regulation of the cell cycle. Unlike its four other family members, the role of Plk4 in embryonic development has not been well characterized. In mice, Plk4 embryos arrest at E7.5, just prior to the initiation of somitogenesis. This has led to the hypothesis that Plk4 expression may be essential to somitogenesis. Recently characterized human mutations lead to Seckel Syndrome. Riboprobe in situ hybridization revealed that plk4 is ubiquitously expressed during early stages of development of Xenopus and Danio; in later stages, expression in frogs restricts to somites as well as eye, otic vesicle, and branchial arch, and brain. Expression patterns in fish remain ubiquitous. Both somite and eye development require planar cell polarity, and disruption of plk4 function in frog by means of morpholino-mediated translational knockdown yields orientational disorganization of both these structures. These results provide the first steps in defining a new role for plk4 in organogenesis and implies a role in planar cell polarity, segmentation, and in recently described PLK4 mutations in human.",Centrosome | Lens | Polarity | Polo like kinase | Somite,1,0,,undefined,

All rights reserved. Tonic immobility is a widely used technique for the surgical implantation of acoustic tags in elasmobranchs (sharks, skates, and rays), yet it is still not broadly recognised as an acceptable procedure by many regulatory bodies, animal care committees, and even journal ethics standards. To highlight its regular use and applicability as a field procedure, a literature search was conducted on the anaesthetic technique adopted for all existing elasmobranch-focused acoustic telemetry papers, up to 31 December 2013. A total of 57 studies were identified that contained relevant details on surgical methodological procedures. Of these, the majority of studies (43, or 75.4%) employed tonic immobility, while 10 (17.6%) used general chemical anaesthetic and 4 (7%) used local chemical anaesthetic. These studies identify that tonic immobility provides an effective anaesthetic for surgical implantation in elasmobranchs, as it offers several benefits over chemical anaesthetics, both from a practical and from an animal welfare perspective. Practically, rapid induction and recovery optimizes the surgical procedure, desirable under often complex field conditions, where general chemical anaesthetics prolong duration and administration is often unfeasible because of the size of study animals. Benefits over chemical anaesthetic for animal welfare include no risk of overdose, no uptake of chemicals to body tissues, minimal disruption to respiration, thereby reducing potential for negative sublethal impacts that influence postrelease behaviour, and immediate and full recovery. Given these benefits and its long-standing use in field studies, it is recommended that tonic immobility be recognised as an acceptable anaesthetic technique for surgical procedures on elasmobranchs.",,13,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

High-throughput sequencing (HTS) is rapidly becoming a popular and robust tool to characterize biodiversity of complex communities, especially for those dominated by microscopic species such as zooplankton. The popular use of HTS-based methods has prompted a possible method of inferring relative species abundance from sequencing data. However, these methods remain largely untested in many communities as to whether sequence data can reliably quantify relative species abundance. Here we tested the relationship between species abundance and sequence abundance in zooplankton using 2 methods: (1) spiking known amounts of indicator species into existing zooplankton communities, and (2) comparing results obtained from parallel replicates for the same natural zooplankton communities. Although we detected a general trend that low-abundance species usually corresponded to low-abundance sequence reads, further statistical analyses revealed that sequencing data could not reliably quantify relative species abundance, even for the same indicator species spiked into different zooplankton communities. The distribution of sequence reads statistically varied even between parallel replicates of the same natural zooplankton communities. Our study reveals that sequence abundance may generally qualitatively reflect species abundance as the general trend between these 2 variables exists; however, extra caution is required when using HTS-based approaches to make quantitative inferences regarding zooplankton communities.",Biodiversity | Biomass | High-throughput sequencing | HTS | Small subunit ribosomal DNA | Species abundance | SSU 18S rDNA | Zooplankton,17,1,,undefined,

Diel variation in baseline glucocorticoid (GC) secretion influences energetics and foraging behaviors. In temperate breeding, diurnal vertebrates, studies have shown that daily patterns of baseline GC secretion are influenced by environmental photoperiod, with baseline GCs peaking prior to sunrise to stimulate waking and foraging behaviors. Measures of physiological energy acquisition are also expected to peak in response to foraging activity, but their relationship to GC levels have not been well studied. In contrast to temperate breeding species, virtually nothing is known about diel GC and energetic metabolite secretion in Arctic breeding species, which experience almost constant photoperiods in spring and summer. Using a ten-year dataset, we examined the daily, 24-h pattern of baseline corticosterone (CORT) and triglyceride (TRIG) secretion in approximately 800 female pre-breeding Arctic-nesting common eiders (. Somateria mollissima). We related these traits to environmental photoperiod and to tidal cycle. In contrast to temperate breeding species, we found that that neither time of day nor tidal trend predicted diel variation in CORT or TRIG secretion in Arctic-breeding eiders. Given the narrow window of opportunity for breeding in polar regions, we suggest that eiders must decouple their daily foraging activity from light and tidal cycles if they are to accrue sufficient energy for successful breeding. As CORT is known to influence foraging behavior, the absence of a distinct diel pattern of CORT secretion may therefore be an adaptation to optimize reproductive investment and likelihood for success in some polar-breeding species.",Arctic | Corticosterone | Diel rhythm | Energetic physiology | Sea duck | Triglyceride,4,0,,undefined,

Nutrient-rich, turbid river plumes that are common to large lakes and coastal marine ecosystems have been hypothesized to benefit survival of fish during early life stages by increasing food availability and (or) reducing vulnerability to visual predators. However, evidence that river plumes truly benefit the recruitment process remains meager for both freshwater and marine fishes. Here, we use genotype assignment between juvenile and larval yellow perch (Perca flavescens) from western Lake Erie to estimate and compare recruitment to the age- 0 juvenile stage for larvae residing inside the highly turbid, south-shore Maumee River plume versus those occupying the less turbid, more northerly Detroit River plume. Bayesian genotype assignment of a mixed assemblage of juvenile (age-0) yellow perch to putative larval source populations established that recruitment of larvae was higher from the turbid Maumee River plume than for the less turbid Detroit River plume during 2006 and 2007, but not in 2008. Our findings add to the growing evidence that turbid river plumes can indeed enhance survival of fish larvae to recruited life stages, and also demonstrate how novel population genetic analyses of early life stages can contribute to determining critical early life stage processes in the fish recruitment process.",,5,1,,undefined,

To determine the relative importance of these vectors in Canada’s Arctic, we collected hull and ballast water samples from 13 and 32 vessels, respectively, at Churchill, Manitoba. We compared total abundance and richness of invertebrates transported on hulls versus those in ballast water. We found that hull fouling was associated with higher total abundance and richness of nonindigenous species when compared with ballast water. Additionally, a significant positive richness–total abundance relationship for nonindigenous species for hull fouling but not for ballast water assemblages suggests that the likelihood of a high-risk (i.e., species-rich and high abundance) introduction event is greater for the former than the latter vector. The discovery of viable, widespread nonindigenous barnacles in hull samples further underscores the prominence of hull fouling over ballast water as a vector of nonindigenous species. Our study demonstrates that hull fouling is a more important vector for transfer of nonindigenous species to the Canadian Arctic than ballast water based on abundance and richness of nonindigenous species transported by the two vectors.",,21,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Ballast water has been a principal pathway of non-indigenous species introduction to global ports for much of the 20th century. In an effort to reduce the scale of this pathway, and recognizing forthcoming global regulations that will supplant ballast water exchange (BWE) with ballast water treatment (BWT), we explore whether a combined hybrid treatment of BWE and chlorination (Cl) exceeds individual effects of either BWE or chlorination alone in reducing densities of bacteria, microplankton and macroplankton. Five full-scale trials were conducted on an operational bulk carrier travelling between Canada and Brazil. The hybrid treatment generally had the lowest final densities among all treatments for putative enterococci, Escherichia coli and coliform bacteria, as well as microplankton and macroplankton, with the former two being synergistically lower than individual treatments alone. Microplankton abundance in the hybrid treatment was significantly but antagonistically reduced relative to individual treatments alone. Macroplankton final density was lowest in the hybrid treatment, though the interaction between treatments was not significant. Synthesis and applications. In most cases, the combined hybrid treatment of ballast water exchange (BWE) and chlorination reduced population densities of indicator organisms in ballast water below those proposed by the International Maritime Organization's D-2 performance standards. BWE alone was often ineffective at reducing bacterial and macroplankton densities. Even when performance standards are implemented globally, continued use of BWE could further reduce risk of invasions to freshwater ecosystems that receive ballast water from foreign sources by accentuating the decline in propagule pressure and enhancing demographic constraints for putative invaders.",Additive | Alien species | Ballast water treatment | Chlorine | IMO-D2 | Non-indigenous | Synergistic,11,0,,undefined,

Ecosystems often experience multiple environmental stressors simultaneously that can differ widely in their pathways and strengths of impact. Differences in the relative impact of environmental stressors can guide restoration and management prioritization, but few studies have empirically assessed a comprehensive suite of stressors acting on a given ecosystem. To fill this gap in the Laurentian Great Lakes, where considerable restoration investments are currently underway, we used expert elicitation via a detailed online survey to develop ratings of the relative impacts of 50 potential stressors. Highlighting the multiplicity of stressors in this system, experts assessed all 50 stressors as having some impact on ecosystem condition, but ratings differed greatly among stressors. Individual stressors related to invasive and nuisance species (e.g., dreissenid mussels and ballast invasion risk) and climate change were assessed as having the greatest potential impacts. These results mark a shift away from the longstanding emphasis on nonpoint phosphorus and persistent bioaccumulative toxic substances in the Great Lakes. Differences in impact ratings among lakes and ecosystem zones were weak, and experts exhibited surprisingly high levels of agreement on the relative impacts of most stressors. Our results provide a basin-wide, quantitative summary of expert opinion on the present-day influence of all major Great Lakes stressors. The resulting ratings can facilitate prioritizing stressors to achieve management objectives in a given location, as well as providing a baseline for future stressor impact assessments in the Great Lakes and elsewhere.",Aquatic | Cumulative impact mapping | Ecological risk assessment | Environmental threats | Expert elicitation | Expert judgment | Questionnaire | Weight of evidence,28,0,NSF,undefined,National Science Foundation

Background: When employing acoustic telemetry to study aquatic species, understanding the functional dynamics of the monitoring system is essential for effective study design, data interpretation, and analysis. Typically, researchers are concerned with maximum effective detection range and consequently tend to employ the largest most powerful tags the study species can carry without considerable energetic burden. In ideal acoustic conditions of low ambient noise environments, low attenuation, and reflective structure, higher powered tags can be detected at larger distances from the receiver, but they can also be subject to the phenomenon 'Close Proximity Detection Interference' (CPDI). This occurs when reflective barriers, such as a calm water surface and/or hard substrate, result in strong transmission echoes that interfere with the transmission sequence. As a result, transmissions in close proximity to the receiver are not effectively decoded and logged. Results: CPDI was assessed from the results of three detection range tests conducted using the Vemco 69kHz telemetry system in three contrasting study systems: a sheltered marine Arctic embayment, a temperate freshwater lake, and an exposed marine sub-tropical reef line. For the Arctic embayment, CPDI was absent with the lower power V9 tag (90% of transmissions received at 55m) but was recorded for the V13 tag and was most prevalent for the highest power V16 tag (18% and 8% of transmissions received at 55m, respectively). Comparing V16 tag detection profiles between study systems, CPDI was evident in the low ambient noise Arctic embayment and temperate freshwater lake (highest transmission proportions recorded at 370 and 207m, respectively) but was absent on the high ambient noise sub-tropical reef line. Functional examples highlight the ways in which CPDI can affect different study designs if not acknowledged or accounted for. Conclusions: CPDI was shown to be the most prominent in low ambient noise study systems and should be considered when choosing tag type/power during study design. If unaccounted for, CPDI could lead to misinterpretation during the analysis of acoustic telemetry data. The identification of CPDI highlights the complexities associated with the functionality of acoustic telemetry systems and supports recommendations for thorough detection range testing.",Acoustic telemetry | CPDI | Detection probability | Detection range test | Doughnut effect,18,1,,undefined,

To illustrate and test our approach, we focus on western Lake Erie's yellow perch (Perca flavescens) population during 2006-2007, using microsatellite DNA and otolith microchemistry from larvae and juveniles as natural tags. Particle backtracking showed that not all larvae collected near a presumed hatching location may have originated there, owing to passive drift during the larval stage that was influenced by strong river- and wind-driven water circulation. Re-assigning larvae to their most probable hatching site (based on probabilistic dispersal trajectories from the particle backtracking model) improved the use of genetics and otolith microchemistry to discriminate among local breeding subpopulations. This enhancement, in turn, altered (and likely improved) the estimated contributions of each breeding subpopulation to the mixed population of juvenile recruits.

We examined chemical tracers of diet and habitat (δ15N and δ13C, respectively) and total mercury (Hg) concentrations in muscle tissue of seven pelagic sharks: blue shark (Prionace glauca), short-fin mako shark (Isurus oxyrinchus), oceanic whitetip shark (Carcharhinus longimanus), scalloped hammerhead shark (Sphyrna lewini), pelagic thresher shark (Alopias pelagicus), crocodile shark (Pseudocarcharias kamoharai) and silky shark (Carcharhinus falciformis), from the data poor south-western tropical Indian Ocean. Minimal interspecific variation in mean δ15N values and a large degree of isotopic niche overlap - driven by high intraspecific variation in δ15N values - was observed among pelagic sharks. Similarly, δ13C values of sharks overlapped considerably for all species with the exception of P. glauca, which had more 13C-depleted values indicating possibly longer residence times in purely pelagic waters. Geographic variation in δ13C, δ15N and Hg were observed for P. glauca and I. oxyrinchus. Mean Hg levels were similar among species with the exception of P. kamoharai which had significantly higher Hg concentrations likely related to mesopelagic feeding. Hg concentrations increased with body size in I. oxyrinchus, P. glauca and C. longimanus. Values of δ15N and δ13C varied with size only in P. glauca, suggesting ontogenetic shifts in diets or habitats. Together, isotopic data indicate that - with few exceptions - variance within species in trophic interactions or foraging habitats is greater than differentiation among pelagic sharks in the south-western Indian Ocean. Therefore, it is possible that this group exhibits some level of trophic redundancy, but further studies of diets and fine-scale habitat use are needed to fully test this hypothesis.",Elasmobranchs | Indian Ocean | Intra-species variations | Trace elements | δ C 13 | δ N 15,24,0,,undefined,

When animals defend resources using territorial signals, they must distinguish between competitors and noncompetitors. Conspecific animals routinely compete for resources and regularly engage in aggressive signalling exchanges. Heterospecific animals may also compete for resources, and therefore animals may direct their aggression towards heterospecific as well as conspecific rivals. In both cases, animals should benefit by discriminating between nonthreatening individuals versus threatening conspecific and heterospecific competitors. Experience may play an important role in competitor discrimination; animals living in sympatry with heterospecific competitors may gain experience with heterospecific rivals, but animals living in allopatry will not. We investigated whether experience influences species discrimination between two congeneric Neotropical wrens (rufous-and-white wrens, Thryophilus rufalbus, and banded wrens, Thryophilus pleurostictus) that live in sympatry in some parts of their range and in allopatry in other parts of their range. We simulated the presence of male conspecific, congeneric and control intruders in the territories of rufous-and-white wrens at sites where they are sympatric or allopatric with banded wrens. If species discrimination is influenced by experience, we predicted that wrens would always respond strongly to conspecific songs, but that in sympatry, they would respond more strongly to the congeneric competitor than to the control songs. Conversely, we predicted that, in allopatry, wrens would show similarly low responses to congener and control songs. In contrast to our predictions, we found that rufous-and-white wrens discriminated between conspecific and heterospecific animals, but that this response did not differ in sympatry or allopatry, suggesting that experience with heterospecific competitors does not influence interspecific discrimination in this species. By contrasting the responses of sympatric and allopatric populations, we can better understand the effect of experience on interspecific discrimination and gain insight into the evolution of species discrimination signals.",Allopatric population | Interspecific competition | Song playback | Species discrimination | Sympatric population | Thryothorus wrens,7,0,,undefined,Government of Ontario

Sexual signals play an important role in mate attraction. In this study, we explore male vocal behavior and female mate attraction in long-tailed manakins, tropical lekking birds where males perform cooperative displays to attract females, and males provide only gametes to choosy females. We monitored female visitation at 37 sites using two techniques: video recordings and automated radiotelemetry. Simultaneously, we used digital recorders to sample male vocal behavior, quantifying vocal output as well as frequency matching and temporal synchrony in male-male duets. We compared male vocal performance to the rate at which females visited male display sites. Video data revealed that both male vocal output and the temporal synchrony of male-male duets were positively related to female visitation, matching our expectations. Telemetry data, in contrast, revealed no such relationship. Our results suggest that telemetry data may yield biased estimates of patterns of female choice, because the tracked females may not adequately represent the pool of potential female visitors to leks. We also demonstrate that male vocal behavior and female visitation vary, in concert, with time of day, peaking in the early morning, with a pronounced drop in the mid-day heat. We compare these results with those of another study, of the same species, in a montane environment with cooler daytime temperatures.",Chiroxiphia linearis | Duet | Female mating behavior | Frequency matching | Lek | Long-tailed manakin | Male vocal behavior | Mate attraction | Temporal synchrony,4,1,CFI,undefined,Canada Foundation for Innovation

Animals store lipids, which are 13C-depleted, in their tissues that often must be extracted to correctly interpret δ13C data. However, chemical lipid extraction (CLE) can alter δ15N values and lipid normalization (LN) models are not consistent across fauna. We determined whether lipids should be extracted by assessing effects of CLE and validating LN models for liver and muscle from seven and eight marine mammal species, respectively, and skin from one species. In liver, CLE significantly increased δ13C and δ15N values for all species, whereas only a significant increase in δ13C occurred in skin. For muscle, δ13C and δ15N values were generally greater after CLE, but this was not consistent across species. Extracted lipids were depleted by approximately 7 and 5 ‰ for δ13C and δ15N, respectively, in both muscle and liver compared with protein in all species. The reliability of LN models varied between tissues and species; thus, their use is largely dependent on the precision of stable isotope values needed to address the objectives of a study.

Vertebrate vocalizations are widespread secondary sexual signals used for mate attraction and territory defence, and variation in signal quality is often condition dependent and impacts reproductive outcomes. Although vocal signal performance is known to reflect various aspects of male quality, few studies have examined the underlying mechanisms mediating its costs and hence its honesty. Using a population of Arctic-breeding snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis), we compared the 'Oxidation Handicap Hypothesis', which predicts that testosterone-induced increases in oxidative stress provide a direct mechanistic basis for ensuring the honesty of many secondary sexual signals, to the 'Aerobic Activity Hypothesis, which predicts that it is the aerobic activity involved with signal production (i.e. vocal performance or defending a large territory) and not testosterone directly that links signal quality and oxidative stress. Males singing at faster rates had higher levels of both reactive oxygen metabolites and non-enzymatic antioxidant capacity in the plasma (i.e. without an increase in overall oxidative stress), enabling certain males to produce high-quality signals while also mitigating the costs of an associated increase in oxidative stress. However, these results were completely independent of plasma testosterone levels, supporting the role of aerobic performance in directly affecting oxidative stress. Although song performance was not linked to reproductive parameters in our data set, our research is the first to test these competing hypotheses in a behavioural trait and results suggest that oxidative stress may be an underlying physiological cost preventing low-quality individuals from producing high-quality signals.",Plectrophenax nivalis | Antioxidant capacity | Bird song | Individual quality | Oxidation handicap hypothesis | Oxidative stress | Reactive oxygen metabolites | Reproductive success,5,0,,undefined,

With favorable abiotic conditions, such as warm temperatures and no precipitation, this carrion resource can be colonized, within minutes after death, by those species that are well adapted to locating such patchy resources. Other species arrive and within a few days, the carrion resource may host tens to hundreds of species and thousands of individuals, developing into a rich, albeit ephemeral, community. Yet how is it similar species are able to utilize the same resources within the carrion simultaneously, whereas other species are excluded? What factors determine who is, and is not, successful? How do these dynamics change when some species are present or excluded? These are some of the questions at the heart of community ecology, and carrion has the advantage of providing the means of testing these questions using multiple replicates and easily manipulated communities that assemble and disperse well within the lifetime of the researcher (see Chapter 7), making them invaluable as model systems.",,1,0,,undefined,

Aquatic ecosystems are threatened by environmental contaminants, and many heavy metals can influence both the structure and function of sense organs in fishes. The use of these senses is vital to the survival and reproductive success of fish and therefore affects the health of the ecosystem as a whole. The current study examines the effects of cadmium on auditory structure and function in the fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas). In the laboratory, fish were exposed for 96 h to a range of cadmium concentrations and both hearing sensitivity and hair cell morphology were quantified. While hair cell numbers were unaffected, cadmium caused an increase in auditory threshold, with a critical range for toxic effects of cadmium estimated at 2.1–2.9 µg L−1. Cadmium exposure also caused a decrease in response latency at higher cadmium concentrations. The current study demonstrates the sublethal effects of cadmium on fish sensory function while also pointing to the need for more careful interpretation of cadmium impacts on aquatic populations.",Auditory evoked potential | Cadmium | Ecotoxicology | Fish | Hearing | Metal contaminants,6,0,NSERC,undefined,Michigan Developmental Disabilities Council

Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology. The growing field of conservation physiology applies a diversity of physiological traits (e.g., immunological, metabolic, endocrine, and nutritional traits) to understand and predict organismal, population, and ecosystem responses to environmental change and stressors. Although the discipline of conservation physiology is gaining momentum, there is still a pressing need to better translate knowledge from physiology into real-world tools. The goal of this symposium, ""Physiology in Changing Landscapes: An Integrative Perspective for Conservation Biology"", was to highlight that many current investigations in ecological, evolutionary, and comparative physiology are necessary for understanding the applicability of physiological measures for conservation goals, particularly in the context of monitoring and predicting the health, condition, persistence, and distribution of populations in the face of environmental change. Here, we outline five major investigations common to environmental and ecological physiology that can contribute directly to the progression of the field of conservation physiology: (1) combining multiple measures of physiology and behavior; (2) employing studies of dose-responses and gradients; (3) combining a within-individual and population-level approach; (4) taking into account the context-dependency of physiological traits; and (5) linking physiological variables with fitness metrics. Overall, integrative physiologists have detailed knowledge of the physiological systems that they study; however, communicating theoretical and empirical knowledge to conservation biologists and practitioners in an approachable and applicable way is paramount to the practical development of physiological tools that will have a tangible impact for conservation.",,18,1,,undefined,

Trophic magnification factors (TMFs) provide a method of assessing chemical biomagnification in food webs and are increasingly being used by policy makers to screen emerging chemicals. Recent reviews have encouraged the use of bioaccumulation models as screening tools for assessing TMFs for emerging chemicals of concern. The present study used a food web bioaccumulation model to estimate TMFs for polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in a riverine system. The uncertainty associated with model predicted TMFs was evaluated against realistic ranges for model inputs (water and sediment PCB contamination) and variation in environmental, physiological, and ecological parameters included within the model. Finally, the model was used to explore interactions between spatial heterogeneity in water and sediment contaminant concentrations and theoretical movement profiles of different fish species included in the model. The model predictions of magnitude of TMFs conformed to empirical studies. There were differences in the relationship between the TMF and the octanol-water partitioning coefficient (K<inf>OW</inf>) depending on the modeling approach used; a parabolic relationship was predicted under deterministic scenarios, whereas a linear TMF-K<inf>OW</inf> relationship was predicted when the model was run stochastically. Incorporating spatial movements by fish had a major influence on the magnitude and variation of TMFs. Under conditions where organisms are collected exclusively from clean locations in highly heterogeneous systems, the results showed bias toward higher TMF estimates, for example the TMF for PCB 153 increased from 2.7 to 5.6 when fish movement was included. Small underestimations of TMFs were found where organisms were exclusively sampled in contaminated regions, although the model was found to be more robust to this sampling condition than the former for this system.",Bioaccumulation model | Spatial movement | Trophic magnification factor | Uncertainty,20,0,,undefined,

All rights reserved. 4.1 INTRODUCTION Covering less than 1% of the Earth’s surface, freshwater - streams, rivers, ponds, wetlands, and lakes - supports as much as 10% of all animal species, including one-third of all vertebrates (Strayer & Dudgeon 2010; Figure 4.1). While being among the most biologically diverse, freshwater ecosystems are also among the most imperiled on the planet. In developed regions such as Europe and USA, more than 30% of freshwater species are now thought to be threatened or extinct. As with the majority of the world’s ecosystems, accelerated rates of human population growth, industrialization, and agricultural intensification are driving these dramatic species losses, with invasive species introductions, over-harvesting, and loss of habitats being the primary causes (Dudgeon 2013). Reducing freshwater biodiversity loss is at odds with managing many other ecosystem services. Much of the conflict lies in the fact that freshwaters are ‘hot spots’ for both human needs (i.e. drinking, irrigation, transportation) as well as biodiversity (i.e. the number or suite of species native to a given area; Strayer & Dudgeon 2010; Leisher, this book). Moreover, the majority of the world’s population is facing, and will continue to face, increasing water scarcity (Vörösmarty et al. 2010). Humans rely heavily on freshwater, and in particular from large rivers for hydropower, transportation, and fisheries. Water abstraction further strains the integrity of a river’s biophysical components, including biodiversity. While some aspects of freshwater ecosystem services are renewable (e.g. water supply), biodiversity is not. This chapter seeks to clarify how ecosystem service-based approaches can be put into practice (‘operationalized’) for the purpose of prioritizing freshwater biodiversity alongside other river services. We propose a framework that is meant to serve as a way to explore trade-offs in ecosystem services delivery. We base this operationalization on three typical perspectives associated with freshwater biodiversity: inherent value as a final service, biodiversity-ecosystem function (an intermediate or provisioning service), and some combination of the two.",,4,0,,undefined,

Through its ability to address complex ecological questions and the possibility of analysing large sample sizes to understand population‑level processes, the use of stable isotope analysis (δ13C and δ15N) has grown rapidly in recent years. Importantly, it is now becoming an accepted tool to derive data for conservation and management planning at the species, community and ecosystem levels. With this acceptance, however, the stable isotope research community faces new challenges to ensure that data are interpreted and presented effectively to maximise their potential for guiding management. We present a case study on stable isotope trends in the vertebrae of white sharks Carcharodon carcharias to show how multiple plausible explanations could be provided to explain the observed isotopic patterns, a point that is likely ubiquitous among isotope studies in ecology. Based on this, we promote that integrating stable isotope data in a multidisciplinary framework will generate the most reliable data for conservationists and resource managers. If this is not possible, we suggest that the isotope community should be more accepting of presenting multiple possible explanations for trends observed in data, rather than focusing on a single interpretation that could potentially misguide management.",carbon isotopes | individualisation | maternal influence | nitrogen isotopes | physiological effects | spatial variation,7,0,,undefined,

Associations between park use and infections with gastrointestinal (GI) parasites in dogs (Canis familiaris) have been previously observed, suggesting park use may pose risks for infection in dogs, and potentially, in humans. This study was conducted to establish the overall level of perceived risk of parasitism in dogs, the frequency of unleashing dogs in parks, and to determine if dog owners' risk perceptions of parasite transmission among humans and dogs are associated with the reported frequency of unleashing dogs. From June to September 2010, 635 surveys were administered to dog owners in nine city parks in Calgary, Alberta, by the lead author to explore dog-walking behaviors in parks under differing leashing regulations. From these, a subset of 316 questionnaires were analyzed to examine associations between behavioral and dog demographic factors, risk perception and acceptability of perceived risks of dog and human parasitism, and education regarding parasitism in dogs and humans. Multivariate statistics were conducted using three separate Chi-Square Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID) decision trees to model risk perception of dogs becoming parasitized while in the park, risk perception of zoonotic transmission, and off-leash frequency. Predictors included recreational behaviors, dog demographics, risk perception of park-based and zoonotic transmission, education regarding parasites, and leashing regulations (e.g. on-leash, off-leash, or mixed management parks). The perceived risk of park-based transmission was relatively higher than perception of zoonotic transmission and the majority of people unleashed their dogs at least some of the time. Risk perception was not associated with off-leash frequency in dogs and risk perception and off-leash frequency were associated with factors other than each other. The results suggest owners may underestimate the potential risks for parasitism related to some dog-walking behaviours, and are relevant for public and animal health.",Dog | Off-leash | Parasitism | Public health | Risk perception | Urban park,2,0,,PGSM-358333-2008,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

When female blow flies Lucilia sericata and Phormia regina (Diptera: Calliphoridae) oviposit in aggregations on carrion, even-aged larval offspring reportedly develop faster, and fewer are parasitized or preyed upon. The benefits of aggregated oviposition equally affect con- and heterospecific larvae sharing a resource. The benefits imply that female blow flies engage in coordinated, pheromone-mediated oviposition behavior. Yet, repeated attempts to identify oviposition pheromones have failed invoking doubt that they exist. Simply by regurgitating and feeding on carrion, flies may produce attractive semiochemicals. If flies were to aggregate in response to feeding flies rather than ovipositing flies, then the semiochemical cue(s) may be associated with the salivary gland. Working with L. sericata and P. regina and using liver as a surrogate oviposition medium, we test the hypotheses, and present data in their support, that (i) gravid or nongravid females ovipositing and/or feeding on liver enhance its attractiveness to gravid and nongravid females; (ii) females respond to semiochemicals from feeding heterospecific females; (iii) females respond equally well to semiochemicals from feeding con- and heterospecific females; (iv) macerated head tissues of females applied to liver enhance its attractiveness; and (v) females in direct contact with and feeding on liver, but not when next to yet physically separated from liver, enhance attraction of flies. We conclude that oviposition site-seeking females do not respond to an oviposition pheromone. Instead, they appear to coopt semiochemicals associated with feeding flies as resource indicators, taking chances that resources are suitable for oviposition, and that ovipositing flies are present.",Blow flies | Carrion | Egg-laying site | Pheromone | Saliva | Semiochemical,18,0,,undefined,

Little work has been done to quantify the number of eggs oviposited by blow flies (Diptera: Calliphoridae) in studies examining colonization behavior. Egg counting methods currently available are time-consuming and destructive. This study used ImageJ software and analysis of covariance to relate the volume of egg masses to the number of eggs laid by three different blow fly species: Lucilia sericata (Meigen), Phormia regina (Meigen), and Chrysomya rufifacies (Macquart). Egg mass volume, species, and the interaction of species and egg mass volume all affected the number of blow fly eggs deposited in egg masses. Both species identity and egg mass volume are important when predicting egg number, as such a single regression equation cannot be used to estimate egg number for these three species. Therefore, simple linear regression equations were determined for each species. The volume of individual eggs was incorporated into the model, yet differences between species were observed, suggesting that the orientation of the eggs oviposited by multiple conspecific females within egg masses influences egg estimates. Based on our results, we expect that imaging software can be used for other blow fly species, as well as other insect species; however, equations specific to each species must be developed. This study describes an important tool for quantifying egg deposition in a nondestructive manner, which is important in studying the colonization behavior and life history of insects of ecological and forensic importance.",blow fly | clutch size sampling | egg mass | ImageJ | oviposition,3,0,,undefined,Ministry of Research and Innovation

Microbial communities are responsible for the bulk of biogeochemical processing in temporary headwater streams, yet there is still relatively little known about how community structure and function respond to periodic drying. Moreover, the ability to sample temporary habitats can be a logistical challenge due to the limited capability to measure and predict the timing, intensity and frequency of wet-dry events. Unsurprisingly, published datasets on microbial community structure and function are limited in scope and temporal resolution and vary widely in the molecular methods applied. We compared environmental and microbial community datasets for permanent and temporary tributaries of two different North American headwater stream systems: Speed River (Ontario, Canada) and Parkers Creek (Maryland, USA). We explored whether taxonomic diversity and community composition were altered as a result of flow permanence and compared community composition amongst streams using different 16S microbial community methods (i.e., T-RFLP and Illumina MiSeq). Contrary to our hypotheses, and irrespective of method, community composition did not respond strongly to drying. In both systems, community composition was related to site rather than drying condition. Additional network analysis on the Parkers Creek dataset indicated a shift in the central microbial relationships between temporary and permanent streams. In the permanent stream at Parkers Creek, associations of methanotrophic taxa were most dominant, whereas associations with taxa from the order Nitrospirales were more dominant in the temporary stream, particularly during dry conditions. We compared these results with existing published studies from around the world and found a wide range in community responses to drying. We conclude by proposing three hypotheses that may address contradictory results and, when tested across systems, may expand understanding of the responses of microbial communities in temporary streams to natural and human-induced fluctuations in flow-status and permanence.",Bacterial diversity | Microbial ecology | Operational taxonomic unit (OTU) | Temporary streams,18,1,,undefined,

To determine whether early rearing environment and parental breeding strategy affect the social behaviour and the endocrine response to stressors in juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), offspring (1-2 g) from traditional hatchery breeding or parental mate choice breeding were reared in a hatchery setting or in seminatural channels. Once ~30 g, 9-monthold hatchery and mate choice fish from both rearing environments were exposed to one of four treatments: (i) sampled, (ii) air-exposed (AE) for 60 s and sampled 1 h later, (iii) sampled after 5 days of continuous dyadic social interaction (SI), or (iv) AE and allowed to interact for 5 days (AE/SI). In the hatchery environment, while hatchery fish were dominant in 70% and 80% of the dyadic trials in the SI and AE/SI treatments, respectively, plasma cortisol, growth hormone, and insulin-like growth factor I levels did not differ between hatchery and mate choice fish. In contrast, when reared in a seminatural environment, mate choice fish were dominant in 70% of the dyadic trials in the SI and AE/SI treatments, and clear differences in plasma hormone levels emerged between hatchery and mate choice fish. Therefore, while we found no evidence that breeding strategy affects social status, familiarity with the early rearing environment (i.e., from emergence until 1-2 g) enhanced the competitive ability of juvenile Chinook salmon during dyadic interactions. Early rearing environment also affected the endocrine responses to stressors, and freshwater seminatural channel environments were associated with elevated hormonal responsiveness.",,3,0,,undefined,

The effects of inbreeding in both captive and wild-caught species and populations have been reported to affect a wide variety of life history traits. Recently, the effects of inbreeding on reproductive traits such as sperm quality have become a subject of particular interest for conservation biology, evolutionary ecology, and management of captive populations. This study investigated the effects of inbreeding on sperm quality in a captive population of experimentally inbred and outbred lake trout, Salvelinus namaycush. It was found for moderately to highly inbred males (males with half-sib and full-sib parents, respectively), that sperm quality traits (velocity, motility, linearity, longevity, spermatocrit and morphology) showed no apparent inbreeding depression. The apparent lack of inbreeding effects on sperm quality traits may be due to several factors including (i) no inbreeding depression in the studied population, due to purging, low levels of inbreeding or lack of detection at the gametic level, or (ii) relaxed selective pressures due to benign hatchery conditions. The present study provides significant insight into the effects of inbreeding on sperm quality in a captive-bred salmonid population, and has important implications for hatchery rehabilitation programs for this species.",,3,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Although studies addressing natural selection have primarily focused on additive genetic effects because of their direct relationship with responses to selection, nonadditive genetic and maternal effects can also significantly influence phenotypes. We partitioned the phenotypic variance of survival and fitness-related traits in juvenile Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) from three allopatric populations (LaHave, Sebago, and Saint-Jean) into additive genetic, nonadditive genetic, and maternal environmental effects using a full-factorial breeding design. We also modelled the potential increase in offspring performance if nonrandom mating (e.g., mate choice) is considered instead of random mating. The three populations exhibited significant differences in trait values as well as the genetic architecture of the traits. Nevertheless, nonadditive genetic and maternal environmental effects tended to be larger than the additive genetic effects. There was also a shift from maternal environmental to genetic effects during development in two of the populations. That is, maternal environmental effects were larger at early (egg and alevin) life stages, whereas nonadditive effects were larger at the later (fry) life stage. The amount of additive genetic effects was small, suggesting the traits will respond slowly to selection. We discuss how different maternal environmental effects across years may influence the genetic architecture of offspring traits.",,11,0,,undefined,

A main goal of population geneticists is to study patterns of gene flow to gain a better understanding of the population structure in a given organism. To date most efforts have been focused on studying gene flow at either broad scales to identify barriers to gene flow and isolation by distance or at fine spatial scales in order to gain inferences regarding reproduction and local dispersal. Few studies have measured connectivity at multiple spatial scales and have utilized novel tools to test the influence of both environment and geography on shaping gene flow in an organism. Here a seascape genetics approach was used to gain insight regarding geographic and ecological barriers to gene flow of a common reef sponge, Stylissa carteri in the Red Sea. Furthermore, a small-scale (<1 km) analysis was also conducted to infer reproductive potential in this organism. At the broad scale, we found that sponge connectivity is not structured by geography alone, but rather, genetic isolation in the southern Red Sea correlates strongly with environmental heterogeneity. At the scale of a 50-m transect, spatial autocorrelation analyses and estimates of full-siblings revealed that there is no deviation from random mating. However, at slightly larger scales (100-200 m) encompassing multiple transects at a given site, a greater proportion of full-siblings was found within sites versus among sites in a given location suggesting that mating and/or dispersal are constrained to some extent at this spatial scale. This study adds to the growing body of literature suggesting that environmental and ecological variables play a major role in the genetic structure of marine invertebrate populations.",Environmental gradient | Isolation by distance | Isolation by environment | Porifera | Relatedness | Seascape genetics,32,1,,undefined,

Modifications to riverine systems that alter freshwater inflow to downstream estuarine habitats have resulted in altered patterns of nekton distribution and abundance. To examine how nekton assemblages respond to variable hydrologic patterns, we used trawl and seine survey data to compare the seasonal trends (dry vs. wet season) expected of a natural system to those of a river with regulated flow discharges that often magnify high flow events. Nekton assemblages differed between seasons in a representative natural system, similar to other estuaries of the region. For example, assemblage differences were characterized by significantly higher abundance and richness in trawl surveys, and significantly higher richness in seine surveys in the wet relative to the dry season. These seasonal trends were dampened in the altered system. Species important in defining seasonal dissimilarities in both systems were characterized as estuarine resident species, including Anchoa mitchilli, Menidia spp., Cynoscion arenarius, and Trinectes maculatus, yet were observed largely to have opposing seasonal trends in abundance between the two rivers.

River otter scat samples (n=77) and blood samples (n=16) collected through non-invasive field collections and live-capture activities (November 2009 to October 2010) along the coastline of Southern Vancouver Island, near Victoria, British Columbia (BC) were analyzed for polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). ∑PBDEs were highest in urbanized regions of Victoria Harbour for blood (1.12μg/g lipid weight) and scat (0.35μg/g lipid weight). A location effect between zones was confirmed statistically for blood but not for scat. Specific congeners with the highest concentrations overall were BDE-47 in blood samples (0.37μg/g lipid weight) and BDE-206 (0.18μg/g lipid weight) and BDE-47 (0.16μg/g lipid weight) in scat samples. There was also an unusual finding of extremely high levels of BDE-209 in 2 scat samples (163 and 956μg/g lipid weight). The patterns of select congeners (BDE 47, 99, 100, 153, 154) measured in blood and scat were found not to be significantly different (Chi-square Test, X2=21.08, DF=4, p=0003). The most prominent congeners within Victoria Harbour were BDE-47 for both blood (0.82mg/kg lipid weight) and scat (0.26mg/kg lipid weight) followed by BDE-206 (0.18μg/g lipid weight) and BDE-207 (0.10μg/g lipid weight) for scat only.

Many birds and primates use loud vocalizations to mediate agonistic interactions with conspecifics, either as solos by males or females, or as coordinated duets. The extensive variation in duet complexity, the contribution of each sex, and the context in which duets are produced suggest that duets may serve several functions, including territory and mate defense. Titi monkeys (Callicebus spp.) are believed to defend their home range via solo loud calls or coordinated duets. Yet there are remarkably few experimental studies assessing the function of these calls. Observations of interactions between wild established groups and solitary individuals are rare and, therefore, controlled experiments are required to simulate such situations and evaluate the mate and joint territorial defense hypotheses. We conducted playback experiments with three free-ranging groups of habituated black-fronted titi monkeys (Callicebus nigrifrons) to test these hypotheses. We found that titi monkeys responded to the three conspecific playback treatments (duets, female solos, and male solos) and did not respond to the heterospecific control treatment. The monkeys did not show sex-specific responses to solos (N=12 trials). Partners started to duet together in 79% of their responses to playback-simulated rivals (N=14 calls in response to playback). Males started to approach the loudspeaker before females regardless of the type of stimulus. The strength of the response of mated pairs to all three conspecific treatments was similar. Overall, our results are consistent with the idea that black-fronted titi monkeys use their loud calls in intergroup communication as a mechanism of joint territorial defense.",Long calls | Loud calls | Mate defense | Primates | Territory defense,12,0,,undefined,

Many territorial animals exhibit reduced aggression towards neighbours. Known as “the dear enemy effect”, this phenomenon has been documented among conspecific animals across a wide range of animal taxa. In theory, the dear enemy effect can also exist between individuals of different species, particularly when those species compete for shared resources. To date, a heterospecific dear enemy effects has only been documented in ants. In this study, we test for both a conspecific and heterospecific dear enemy effect in neotropical rufous-and-white wrens Thryophilus rufalbus. This species competes for resources with banded wrens Thryophilus pleurostictus, a closely related sympatric congener. We used acoustic playback to simulate rufous- and-white wren and banded wren neighbours and non-neighbours at the edges of rufous-and-white wren territories. Rufous- and-white wrens responded more strongly to signals from their own species, demonstrating that resident males discriminate between conspecific and heterospecific rivals. They did not, however, exhibit a conspecific dear enemy effect. Further, they did not exhibit a heterospecific dear enemy effect. This could be due to neighbours and non-neighbours posing similar levels of threat in this system, to the possibility that playback from the edges of the subjects’ large territories did not simulate a threatening signal, or to other factors. Our study provides the first test of a heterospecific dear enemy effect in vertebrates, and presents a valuable experimental approach for testing for a heterospecific dear enemy effect in other animals",Conspecific aggression | Dear enemy effect | Heterospecific aggression | Inter-specific interactions | Intra-specific interactions | Resource competition,8,1,,undefined,

Quantifying spatial genetic structure can reveal the relative influences of contemporary and historic factors underlying localized and regional patterns of genetic diversity and gene flow - important considerations for the development of effective conservation efforts. Using 10 polymorphic microsatellite loci, we characterize genetic variation among populations across the range of the Eastern Sand Darter (Ammocrypta pellucida), a small riverine percid that is highly dependent on sandy substrate microhabitats. We tested for fine scale, regional, and historic patterns of genetic structure. As expected, significant differentiation was detected among rivers within drainages and among drainages. At finer scales, an unexpected lack of within-river genetic structure among fragmented sandy microhabitats suggests that stratified dispersal resulting from unstable sand bar habitat degradation (natural and anthropogenic) may preclude substantial genetic differentiation within rivers. Among-drainage genetic structure indicates that postglacial (14 kya) drainage connectivity continues to influence contemporary genetic structure among Eastern Sand Darter populations in southern Ontario. These results provide an unexpected contrast to other benthic riverine fish in the Great Lakes drainage and suggest that habitat-specific fishes, such as the Eastern Sand Darter, can evolve dispersal strategies that overcome fragmented and temporally unstable habitats.",Eastern Sand Darter | Fragmented habitat | Genetic diversity | Genetic structure | Stratified dispersal,11,1,,undefined,

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. DNA metabarcoding is a promising method for describing communities and estimating biodiversity. This approach uses high-throughput sequencing of targeted markers to identify species in a complex sample. By convention, sequences are clustered at a predefined sequence divergence threshold (often 3%) into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that serve as a proxy for species. However, variable levels of interspecific marker variation across taxonomic groups make clustering sequences from a phylogenetically diverse dataset into OTUs at a uniform threshold problematic. In this study, we use mock zooplankton communities to evaluate the accuracy of species richness estimates when following conventional protocols to cluster hypervariable sequences of the V4 region of the small subunit ribosomal RNA gene (18S) into OTUs. By including individually tagged single specimens and ""populations"" of various species in our communities, we examine the impact of intra- and interspecific diversity on OTU clustering. Communities consisting of single individuals per species generated a correspondence of 59-84% between OTU number and species richness at a 3% divergence threshold. However, when multiple individuals per species were included, the correspondence between OTU number and species richness dropped to 31-63%. Our results suggest that intraspecific variation in this marker can often exceed 3%, such that a single species does not always correspond to one OTU. We advocate the need to apply group-specific divergence thresholds when analyzing complex and taxonomically diverse communities, but also encourage the development of additional filtering steps that allow identification of artifactual rRNA gene sequences or pseudogenes that may generate spurious OTUs. Using four mock zooplankton communities, we validate the metabarcoding method by evaluating the accuracy of species richness estimates generated when clustering hypervariable sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs). By individually tagging single individuals and ""populations"" of various species in our communities, we examine the impact of intra- and interspecific diversity on OTU clustering.

Ecology and Evolution published by John Wiley  &  Sons Ltd. Metabarcoding has the potential to become a rapid, sensitive, and effective approach for identifying species in complex environmental samples. Accurate molecular identification of species depends on the ability to generate operational taxonomic units (OTUs) that correspond to biological species. Due to the sometimes enormous estimates of biodiversity using this method, there is a great need to test the efficacy of data analysis methods used to derive OTUs. Here, we evaluate the performance of various methods for clustering length variable 18S amplicons from complex samples into OTUs using a mock community and a natural community of zooplankton species. We compare analytic procedures consisting of a combination of (1) stringent and relaxed data filtering, (2) singleton sequences included and removed, (3) three commonly used clustering algorithms (mothur, UCLUST, and UPARSE), and (4) three methods of treating alignment gaps when calculating sequence divergence. Depending on the combination of methods used, the number of OTUs varied by nearly two orders of magnitude for the mock community (60-5068 OTUs) and three orders of magnitude for the natural community (22-22191 OTUs). The use of relaxed filtering and the inclusion of singletons greatly inflated OTU numbers without increasing the ability to recover species. Our results also suggest that the method used to treat gaps when calculating sequence divergence can have a great impact on the number of OTUs. Our findings are particularly relevant to studies that cover taxonomically diverse species and employ markers such as rRNA genes in which length variation is extensive.",18S rRNA | Biodiversity | eDNA | High-throughput sequencing | Metabarcoding | OTU,69,1,,undefined,

Predator-prey interactions are mediated by the structural complexity of habitats, but disentangling the many facets of structure that contribute to this mediation remains elusive. In a world replete with altered landscapes and biological invasions, determining how structure mediates the interactions between predators and novel prey will contribute to our understanding of invasions and predator-prey dynamics in general. Here, using simplified experimental arenas, we manipulate predator-free space, whilst holding surface area and volume constant, to quantify the effects on predator-prey interactions between two resident gammarid predators and an invasive prey, the Ponto-Caspian corophiid Chelicorophium curvispinum. Systematically increasing predator-free space alters the functional responses (the relationship between prey density and consumption rate) of the amphipod predators by reducing attack rates and lengthening handling times. Crucially, functional response shape also changes subtly from destabilizing Type II towards stabilizing Type III, such that small increases in predator-free space to result in significant reductions in prey consumption at low prey densities. Habitats with superficially similar structural complexity can have considerably divergent consequences for prey population stability in general and, particularly, for invasive prey establishing at low densities in novel habitats.",Chelicorophium curvispinum | Gammarus | Habitat complexity | Nonlinear interactions | Predator-prey dynamics | Type II | Type III,41,0,,undefined,

One of the major challenges facing conservation biology is characterizing the genetic variation underlying adaptation to different environments. Gene expression is the process whereby genomic information is converted into phenotype and quantitative variation in gene expression is linked to phenotypic variation. Identifying gene transcription profiles that provide fitness benefits in specific environments would promote more effective species reintroduction and conservation practices. In this study, we developed a custom oligonucleotide microarray for Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) and used this microarray to measure gene transcription in gill tissue for two Atlantic salmon strains currently being reintroduced into Lake Ontario: LaHave (anadromous) and Sebago (landlocked). We measured gene transcription in juvenile salmon from each strain that had been reared under the same conditions and identified genes differentially expressed between the two strains. We used the normalized transcription data and microsatellite genotype data to partition the variance into effects of selection versus genetic drift. We found that although there was little genetic differentiation (FST = 0.038) between the two strains, 21 genes were significantly differentially expressed between the two strains, and in all cases the difference was consistent with divergence by selection. We use this analysis to predict the Sebago strain will be more likely to be successfully reintroduced, highlighting how the combination of population genetics with gene expression can help to guide reintroduction efforts.",Conservation | F ST | Gene expression | Lake Ontario | Microarray | P ST | Reintroduction | Salmon,4,0,,undefined,

In many species, empirical data suggest that temperatures less than 1 month before breeding strongly influence laying date, consistent with predictions that short lag times between cue and response are more reliable, decreasing the chance of mismatch with prey. Here we show in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) that mid-winter temperature ca 50–90 days before laying (8 January–22 February) strongly (r2 =0.89) predicts annual variation in laying date. Mid-winter temperature also correlated highly with relative clutch size: birds laid later, but laid larger clutches, in years when mid-winter temperatures were lower. Despite a high degree of breeding synchrony (mean laying date 5–13 April=±4 days; 80% of nests laid within 4.8 days within year), European starlings show strong date-dependent variation in clutch size and productivity, but this appears to be mediated by a different temporal mechanism for integration of supplemental cue (temperature) information. We suggest the relationship between mid-winter temperature and breeding phenology might be indirect with both components correlating with a third factor: temperature-dependent development of the starling’s insect (tipulid) prey. Mid-winter temperatures might set the trajectory of growth and final biomass of tipulid larvae, with this temperature cue providing starlings with information on breeding season prey availability (though exactly how remains unknown).",Breeding phenology | Clutch size | Egg-laying date | Temperature | Tipulids,15,1,,undefined,

Integrative biologists have long appreciated that the effective acquisition and management of energy prior to breeding should strongly influence fitness-related reproductive decisions (timing of breeding and reproductive investment). However, because of the difficulty in capturing pre-breeding individuals, and the tendency towards abandonment of reproduction after capture, we know little about the underlying mechanisms of these life-history decisions. Over 10 years, we captured free-living, arctic-breeding common eiders (Somateria mollissima) up to 3 weeks before investment in reproduction. We examined and characterized physiological parameters predicted to influence energetic management by sampling baseline plasma glucocorticoids (i.e., corticosterone), very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and vitellogenin (VTG) for their respective roles in mediating energetic balance, rate of condition gain (physiological fattening rate) and reproductive investment. Baseline corticosterone increased significantly from arrival to the initiation of reproductive investment (period of rapid follicular growth; RFG), and showed a positive relationship with body mass, indicating that this hormone may stimulate foraging behaviour to facilitate both fat deposition and investment in egg production. In support of this, we found that VLDL increased throughout the pre-breeding period, peaking as predicted during RFG. Female eiders exhibited unprecedentedly high levels of VTG well before their theoretical RFG period, a potential strategy for pre-emptively depositing available protein stores into follicles while females are simultaneously fattening. This study provides some of the first data examining the temporal dynamics and interaction of the energetic mechanisms thought to be at the heart of individual variation in reproductive decisions and success in many vertebrate species.",Breeding threshold | Corticosterone | Energetic management | Energetic metabolites | Mixed-strategy breeder,17,0,,undefined,

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) remain chemicals of concern more than three decades after the ban on their production. Technical mixture-based total PCB measurements are unreliable due to weathering and degradation, while detailed full congener specific measurements can be time-consuming and costly for large studies. Measurements using a subset of indicator PCBs (iPCBs) have been considered appropriate; however, inclusion of different PCB congeners in various iPCB schemes makes it challenging to readily compare data. Here, using an extensive data set, we examine the performance of existing iPCB3 (PCB 138, 153, and 180), iPCB6 (iPCB3 plus 28, 52, and 101) and iPCB7 (iPCB6 plus 118) schemes, and new iPCB schemes in estimating total of PCB congeners (ΣPCB) and dioxin-like PCB toxic equivalent (dlPCB-TEQ) concentrations in sport fish fillets and the whole body of juvenile fish. The coefficients of determination (R2) for regressions conducted using logarithmically transformed data suggest that inclusion of an increased number of PCBs in an iPCB improves relationship with ΣPCB but not dlPCB-TEQs. Overall, novel iPCB3 (PCB 95, 118, and 153), iPCB4 (iPCB3 plus 138) and iPCB5 (iPCB4 plus 110) presented in this study and existing iPCB6 and iPCB7 are the most optimal indicators, while the current iPCB3 should be avoided. Measurement of ΣPCB based on a more detailed analysis (50+ congeners) is also overall a good approach for assessing PCB contamination and to track PCB origin in fish. Relationships among the existing and new iPCB schemes have been presented to facilitate their interconversion. The iPCB6 equiv levels for the 6.5 and 10 pg/g benchmarks of dlPCB-TEQ05 are about 50 and 120 ng/g ww, respectively, which are lower than the corresponding iPCB6 limits of 125 and 300 ng/g ww set by the European Union.",,11,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

The white shark, Carcharodon carcharias, is both one of the largest apex predators in the world and among the most heavily protected marine fish. Population genetic diversity is in part shaped by recent demographic history and can thus provide information complementary to more traditional population assessments, which are difficult to obtain for white sharks and have at times been controversial. Here, we use the mitochondrial control region and 14 nuclear-encoded microsatellite loci to assess white shark genetic diversity in 2 regions: the Northwest Atlantic (NWA, N = 35) and southern Africa (SA, N = 131). We find that these 2 regions harbor genetically distinct white shark populations (Φ <inf>ST</inf> = 0.10, P < 0.00001; microsatellite F <inf>ST</inf> = 0.1057, P < 0.021). M-ratios were low and indicative of a genetic bottleneck in the NWA (M-ratio = 0.71, P < 0.004) but not SA (M-ratio = 0.85, P = 0.39). This is consistent with other evidence showing a steep population decline occurring in the mid to late 20th century in the NWA, whereas the SA population appears to have been relatively stable. Estimates of effective population size ranged from 22.6 to 66.3 (NWA) and 188 to 1998.3 (SA) and evidence of inbreeding was found (primarily in NWA). Overall, our findings indicate that white population dynamics within NWA and SA are determined more by intrinsic reproduction than immigration and there is genetic evidence of a population decline in the NWA, further justifying the strong domestic protective measures that have been taken for this species in this region. Our study also highlights how assessment of genetic diversity can complement other sources of information to better understand the status of threatened marine fish populations.",bottleneck | effective population size Ne | inbreeding,14,1,,undefined,

Life-stage-based management of marine fishes requires information on juvenile habitat preferences to ensure sustainable population demographics. This is especially important in the Arctic region given very little is known about the life histories of many native species, yet exploitation by developing commercial and artisanal fisheries is increasing as the ice extent decreases. Through scientific surveys and bycatch data from gillnet fisheries, we document captures of rarely reported juvenile Greenland sharks (Somniosus microcephalus; ≤200 cm total length [TL]) during the ice-free period in the Canadian Arctic. A total of 22 juvenile animals (42 % of total catch; n = 54), including the smallest reliably measured individual of 117 cm TL, were caught on scientific longlines and bottom trawls in Scott Inlet and Sam Ford Trough over three consecutive years. Molecular genetic nuclear markers confirmed species identity for 44 of these sharks sampled; however, two sharks including a juvenile of 150 cm TL were identified as carrying a Pacific sleeper shark (Somniosus pacificus) mitochondrial cytochrome b (cyt b) haplotype. This represents the first record of a Pacific sleeper shark genetic signature in Greenland sharks in Eastern Arctic waters. Juvenile sharks caught as bycatch in gillnet fisheries were only observed offshore in Baffin Bay surrounding a fishery closure area, while larger subadult and mature Greenland sharks (>200 cm TL) were caught in all fishing locations, including areas where juveniles were observed. The repeatable occurrence of juvenile Greenland sharks in a fjord and their presence at two offshore sites indicates that these smaller animals either reside in nurseries or have defined home ranges in both coastal and offshore regions or undertake large-scale inshore–offshore movements.",Baffin Bay | Genetics | Greenland shark | Juvenile sharks | Nursery grounds | Pacific sleeper shark | Sam Ford Trough | Scott Inlet,6,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Excess nitrogen (N) is a primary driver of freshwater and coastal eutrophication globally, and urban stormwater is a rapidly growing source of N pollution. Stormwater best management practices (BMPs) are used widely to remove excess N from runoff in urban and suburban areas, and are expected to perform under a wide variety of environmental conditions. Yet the capacity of BMPs to retain excess N varies; and both the variation and the drivers thereof are largely unknown, hindering the ability of water resource managers to meet water quality targets in a cost-effective way. Here, we use structured expert judgment (SEJ), a performance-weighted method of expert elicitation, to quantify the uncertainty in BMP performance under a range of site-specific environmental conditions and to estimate the extent to which key environmental factors influence variation in BMP performance. We hypothesized that rain event frequency and magnitude, BMP type and size, and physiographic province would significantly influence the experts' estimates of N retention by BMPs common to suburban Piedmont and Coastal Plain watersheds of the Chesapeake Bay region. Expert knowledge indicated wide uncertainty in BMP performance, with N removal efficiencies ranging from <0% (BMP acting as a source of N during a rain event) to >40%. Experts believed that the amount of rain was the primary identifiable source of variability in BMP efficiency, which is relevant given climate projections of more frequent heavy rain events in the mid-Atlantic. To assess the extent to which those projected changes might alter N export from suburban BMPs and watersheds, we combined downscaled estimates of rainfall with distributions of N loads for different-sized rain events derived from our elicitation. The model predicted higher and more variable N loads under a projected future climate regime, suggesting that current BMP regulations for reducing nutrients may be inadequate in the future.",,10,1,,undefined,

Targeted therapies and the consequent adoption of ""personalized"" oncology have achieved notablesuccesses in some cancers; however, significant problems remain with this approach. Many targetedtherapies are highly toxic, costs are extremely high, and most patients experience relapse after a fewdisease-free months. Relapses arise from genetic heterogeneity in tumors, which harbor therapy-resistantimmortalized cells that have adopted alternate and compensatory pathways (i.e., pathways that are notreliant upon the same mechanisms as those which have been targeted). To address these limitations, aninternational task force of 180 scientists was assembled to explore the concept of a low-toxicity ""broad-spectrum"" therapeutic approach that could simultaneously target many key pathways and mechanisms. Using cancer hallmark phenotypes and the tumor microenvironment to account for the various aspectsof relevant cancer biology, interdisciplinary teams reviewed each hallmark area and nominated a widerange of high-priority targets (74 in total) that could be modified to improve patient outcomes. For thesetargets, corresponding low-toxicity therapeutic approaches were then suggested, many of which werephytochemicals. Proposed actions on each target and all of the approaches were further reviewed forknown effects on other hallmark areas and the tumor microenvironment. Potential contrary or procar-cinogenic effects were found for 3.9% of the relationships between targets and hallmarks, and mixedevidence of complementary and contrary relationships was found for 7.1%. Approximately 67% of therelationships revealed potentially complementary effects, and the remainder had no known relationship. Among the approaches, 1.1% had contrary, 2.8% had mixed and 62.1% had complementary relationships. These results suggest that a broad-spectrum approach should be feasible from a safety standpoint. Thisnovel approach has potential to be relatively inexpensive, it should help us address stages and types ofcancer that lack conventional treatment, and it may reduce relapse risks. A proposed agenda for futureresearch is offered.",Cancer hallmarks | Integrative medicine | Multi-targeted | Phytochemicals | Targeted therapy,112,1,NIH,F31CA154080,National Institutes of Health

Detecting those effects however, might be difficult if individuals modulate their physiology and/or behaviours in ways to minimize short-term fitness costs. Corticosterone in feathers (CORTf) is thought to provide information on total baseline and stress-induced CORT levels at moulting and is an integrated measure of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal activity during the time feathers are grown.We predicted that CORTf levels in northern common eider females would relate to subsequent body condition, reproductive success and survival, in a population of eiders nesting in the eastern Canadian Arctic during a capricious period marked by annual avian cholera outbreaks. We collected CORTf data fromfeathers grown during previousmoult in autumn and data on phenology of subsequent reproduction and survival for 242 eider females over 5 years. Using path analyses,we detected a direct relationship between CORTf and arrival date and body condition the following year. CORTf also had negative indirect relationships with both eider reproductive success and survival of eiders during an avian cholera outbreak. This indirect effect was dramatic with a reduction of approximately 30% in subsequent survival of eiders during an avian cholera outbreak when mean CORTf increased by 1 standard deviation. This study highlights the importance of events or processes occurring during moult on subsequent expression of life-history traits and relation to individual fitness, and shows that information from non-destructive sampling of individuals can track carry-over effects across seasons.",Avian cholera | Carry-over effects | Common eider | Feather corticosterone | Moult | Reproductive success,26,1,,undefined,

Analysing how assemblage structure varies during transport may provide insights into how introduction risk changes before propagules are released. Characterization of introduction risk is typically based on assessments of colonization pressure (CP, the number of species transported) and total propagule pressure (total PP, the total abundance of propagules released) associated with an invasion vector. Generally, invasion potential following introduction increases with greater CP or total PP. Here, we extend these assessments using rank-abundance distributions to examine how CP: total PP relationships change temporally in ballast water of ocean-going ships. Rank-abundance distributions and CP: total PP patterns varied widely between trans-Atlantic and trans-Pacific voyages, with the latter appearing to pose a much lower risk than the former. Responses also differed by taxonomic group, with invertebrates experiencing losses mainly in total PP,while diatoms and dinoflagellates sustained losses mainly in CP. In certain cases, open-ocean ballastwater exchange appeared to increase introduction risk by uptake of new species or supplementation of existing ones. Our study demonstrates that rankabundance distributions provide new insights into the utility of CP and PP in characterizing introduction risk.",Ballast water | Colonization pressure | Community structure | Invasion vectors | Invasive species | Propagule pressure,11,1,,undefined,

Knowledge of the trophic ecology and interactions of marine top predators is fundamental for understanding community structure and dynamics as well as ecosystem function. We examined the feeding relationships of 4 heavily exploited elasmobranchs caught in coastal artisanal shark fisheries in south-western Madagascar in 2009 and 2010—Sphyrna lewini, Loxodon macrorhinus, Carcharhinus falciformis and Rhynchobatus djiddensis—using stable isotope (δ15N and δ13C) analysis. Relative trophic position (indicated by δ15N) and foraging location (indicated by δ13C) differed among species. Isotopic niche width was highly variable: more pelagic species, such as S. lewini and C. falciformis, had the broadest isotopic niches while the benthic R. djiddensis had the narrowest. A high percentage of niche overlap occurred between R. djiddensis and 2 of the species, C. falciformis (93.2%) and L. macrorhinus (73.2%), and to a lesser extent S. lewini (13.3%). Relative trophic position of S. lewini significantly increased with size, suggesting a dietary shift with age. Sex differences in δ15N values were observed in L. macrorhinus, suggesting intraspecific niche partitioning. Variation in stable isotope values among these 4 highly exploited elasmobranch species indicates trophic structuring, likely driven by differences in diet and habitat use as well as by size and sex. This study provides the first baseline information on the trophic ecology of elasmobranchs caught in artisanal fisheries from south-western Madagascar.",Artisanal fisheries | Ontogenetic shift | Sex differences | Sharks | Trophic ecology | δ C 13 | δ N 15,8,1,,undefined,

The Brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) is able to survive and reproduce in high levels of environmentally contaminated areas of the Great Lakes. The purpose of this study was to establish whether there are adaptive genetic/molecular changes occurring in these fish that allow for their survival. Expression of a cell cycle regulator, p53 and the toxin metabolizing protein, CYP1A were measured in liver tissue from bullhead caught from either clean or contaminated areas of Lake Erie and surrounding areas. Wild caught fish and F1 raised offspring (whose parents originated from clean and contaminated sites) were used to measure endogenous gene expression levels. Results revealed that endogenous expression of p53 was on average 6.6× higher in contaminated fish than in fish caught from clean sites. Interestingly, when fed benzo(a)pyrene (BaP)-treated food, p53 expression increased 0.2× in clean fish and decreased 2.6× in contaminated fish. Endogenous CYP1A expression was not detectable in clean fish and low in contaminated fish. Upon exposure to BaP-treated food, CYP1A expression increased in both clean and contaminated fish, although at a higher rate in clean fish. Furthermore, when fish were cleared and then re-exposed to BaP, CYP1A expression increased from basal levels at a higher rate in clean versus contaminated fish. CYP1A and p53 expression in F1 offspring was similar to wild caught fish at the endogenous level and when fed BaP treated food. Results suggest that fish in contaminated regions may be implementing an adaptive response to severe environmental stress by maintaining high expression of p53 and low expression of CYP1A; thus lending increased protection to cells and decreasing the potential amount of carcinogens produced by contaminant metabolism.",Adaptation | Benzo(a)pyrene | Brown bullhead | CYP1A | Gene expression | P53,12,0,,807270,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Hydrogen (H2) production using mixed anaerobic cultures often suffers severe yield reduction due to the syntrophic association between H2 consumers (methanogens and homoacetogens) and H2 producers (acidogens). The objective of this study was to uncouple the syntrophic association between H2 producers and consumers by optimizing conditions for minimum H2 consumption using a Box-Behnken design approach. The factors investigated in this study include temperature, pH and linoleic acid (LA) concentration. A quadratic response surface model was developed to predict the H2 consumed by mixed anaerobic cultures and the optimum conditions for minimum H2 consumption were 38 °C, pH 5.5 and 2 g L-1 LA. Methanogenesis was inhibited in cultures fed 2 g L-1 LA and maintained at pH 6.0 and 53 °C. In comparison, both methanogenesis and homoacetogenesis were inhibited in cultures fed 1-2 g L-1 LA and maintained at a pH of 4.5 (Fig. 2B and 2E and Table 2 Expt. # 1, 2 and 11). Microbial diversity analysis revealed that LA fed cultures was dominated by spore forming Clostridium sp. in addition to Syntrophus aciditrophus. In comparison, control cultures were dominated by Eubacterium sp.; Methanocalculus halotolerans and Methanococcoides alaskense. This study described an approach for regulating H2 consumption in mixed cultures by optimizing process and environmental factors. Understanding the effects of these individual factors and their interaction is important in the full-scale operation of H2 production facilities.",Anaerobic mixed cultures | Box-Behnken design | Homoacetogenesis | Hydrogen consumption | Methanogenesis | Statistical,10,0,,13320,University of Windsor

Methods: From June to September 2010, 645 questionnaires were administered to dog owners in nine city parks to determine behavioural and demographic factors, and corresponding feces from 355 dogs were collected. Dog feces were analyzed for helminth and some protozoan species using a modified sugar flotation technique and microscopic examination, a subsample was analyzed for Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp. using a direct immunofluorescence assay. Descriptive and multivariate statistics were conducted to determine associations among behaviours, demographics, and parasite prevalence and infection intensities.Background: In urban parks, dogs, wildlife and humans can be sympatric, introducing the potential for inter- and intra-specific transmission of pathogens among hosts. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of zoonotic and non-zoonotic gastrointestinal parasites in dogs in Calgary city parks, and assess if dog-walking behaviour, park management, history of veterinary care, and dog demographics were associated with parasitism in dogs.Results: Parasite prevalence was 50.2%. Giardia spp. (24.7%), Cryptosporidium spp. (14.7%), and Cystoisospora spp. (16.8%) were the most prevalent parasites. Helminth prevalence was low (4.1%). Presence of Giardia spp. was more likely in intact and young dogs; and infection with any parasite and Giardia spp. intensity were both positively associated with dogs visiting multiple parks coupled with a high frequency of park use and off-leash activity, and with being intact and young. Cryptosporidium spp. intensity was associated with being intact and young, and having visited the veterinarian within the previous year.Conclusions: Our results indicate a higher overall prevalence of protozoa in dogs than previously found in Calgary.

MODIS satellite imagery suggests that high algal biomass events have occurred annually along the southern shore during late summer. In this study, we evaluated these events and tested the hypothesis that summer bloom material derived from Lake St. Clair may enter Lake Erie via the Detroit River and represent an overlooked source of potentially toxic Microcystis biomass to the western basin of Lake Erie. We conducted a seasonally and spatially resolved study carried out in the summer of 2013. Our goals were to: 1) track the development of the 2013 summer south-east shore bloom 2) conduct a spatial survey to characterize the extent of toxicity, taxonomic diversity of the total phytoplankton population and the phylogenetic diversity of potential MC-producing cyanobacteria (Microcystis, Planktothrix and Anabaena) during a high biomass event, and 3) compare the strains of potential MC-producers in Lake St. Clair with strains from Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. Our results demonstrated a clear predominance of cyanobacteria during a late August bloom event, primarily dominated by Microcystis, which we traced along the Lake St. Clair coastline downstream to the Detroit River's outflow at Lake Erie. Microcystin levels exceeded the Province of Ontario Drinking Water Quality Standard (1.5 μg L-1) for safe drinking water at most sites, reaching up to five times this level in some areas. Microcystis was the predominant microcystin producer, and all toxic Microcystis strains found in Lake St. Clair were genetically similar to toxic Microcystis strains found in lakes Erie and Ontario. These findings suggest extensive genetic connectivity among the three systems.",,18,1,,undefined,

Tracking the movements of migratory songbirds poses many challenges because much of their journey takes place at night. One promising technique for studying migratory birds relies on microphones to record the nocturnal flight calls produced by birds on the wing. We compared recordings of night flight calls with bird-banding data in a southern Great Lakes ecosystem. We collected >6,200 hr of nocturnal recordings at 7 locations around Lake Erie. We detected >60,000 flight calls from migratory birds and classified 45,775 calls to species level or to a bioacoustic category comprising several species with similar calls. We compared these acoustic data with records of 5,624 birds captured in mist nets. We found that acoustic recordings accurately quantified the magnitude of migration; comparison with mist-net data revealed significant positive correlations between the number of acoustic detections and the number of mist-net detections across species. We also found that acoustic recordings accurately quantified the timing of migration; we found significant positive correlations between the date of passage of the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of the populations of up to 25 groups of passage migrant species in the acoustic data and mist-net data. A careful examination of 6 species with distinctive flight calls revealed only subtle seasonal differences between peak detections via acoustic monitoring and mist netting, at both daily and weekly timescales. This research enhances our understanding of the role that acoustic sampling can play in monitoring migratory birds, providing important empirical support for the validity of night-flight-call monitoring.",Acoustic monitoring | Migration monitoring | Night flight call | Nocturnal vocalizations | Population monitoring,21,0,,undefined,

We assessed DOM quality and microbial bioavailability in eight first-order Coastal Plain headwater streams along a gradient of urbanization (i.e., percent watershed impervious cover); none of the streams had point source discharges. DOM quality was measured using fluorescence excitation-emission matrices (EEMs) coupled with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Bioavailability was assessed using biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC) incubations. Results showed that watershed impervious cover was significantly related to stream DOM composition: increasing impervious cover was associated with decreased amounts of natural humic-like DOM and enriched amounts of anthropogenic fulvic acid-like and protein-like DOM. Microbial bioavailability of DOM was greater in urbanized streams during spring and summer, and was related to decreasing proportions of humic-like DOM and increasing proportions of protein-like DOM. Increased bioavailability was associated with elevated extracellular enzyme activity of the initial microbial community supplied to samples during BDOC incubations. These findings indicate that changes in stream DOM quality due to watershed urbanization may impact stream ecosystem metabolism and ultimately the fate of organic carbon transported through fluvial systems. © 2014 American Chemical Society.",,92,0,NSF,DBI-1052875,National Science Foundation

We assessed functional community structure, functional diversity (Rao's quadratic entropy) and voltinism in macroinvertebrate communities sampled across the full gradient of anthropogenic stress in Laurentian Great Lakes coastal wetlands. Functional diversity and voltinism significantly decreased with increasing development, whereas agriculture had smaller or non-significant effects. Functional community structure was affected by watershed-scale development, as demonstrated by an ordination analysis followed by regression. Because functional community structure affects energy flow and ecosystem function, and functional diversity is known to have important implications for ecosystem resilience to further environmental change, these results highlight the necessity of finding ways to remediate or at least ameliorate these effects. © 2014 Kovalenko et al.",,11,1,EPA,undefined,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

We observed tail-raising displays toward conspecifics in both intersexual and intrasexual contexts, as well as toward heterospecifics. Displays performed toward heterospecifics were directed at humans, monkeys, or birds of prey, all of which could have been perceived as potential predators. We experimentally tested the possible functions of tail-raising behavior in the presence of a predator by presenting elegant trogons with models of a natural predator and a nonthreatening control. Tail-raising displays were much more likely to occur when trogons were in the presence of a predator model (48% of trials) than a control model (6% of trials). The presence of conspecifics did not influence tail-raising propensity (conspecifics present: 44% of trials and conspecifics absent: 50% of trials).

However, several technical problems, especially sequencing artifacts such as nucleotide calling errors, could artificially inflate biodiversity estimates. Sequence filtering for artifact removal is a conventional method for deleting error-prone sequences from high-throughput sequencing data. As rare species represented by low-abundance sequences in datasets may be sensitive to artifact removal process, the influence of artifact removal on rare species recovery has not been well evaluated in natural complex communities. Here we employed both internal (reliable operational taxonomic units selected from communities themselves) and external (indicator species spiked into communities) references to evaluate the influence of artifact removal on rare species recovery using 454 pyrosequencing of complex plankton communities collected from both freshwater and marine habitats. Multiple analyses revealed three clear patterns: 1) rare species were eliminated during sequence filtering process at all tested filtering stringencies, 2) more rare taxa were eliminated as filtering stringencies increased, and 3) elimination of rare species intensified as biomass of a species in a community was reduced. Our results suggest that cautions be applied when processing high-throughput sequencing data, especially for rare taxa detection for conservation of species at risk and for rapid response programs targeting non-indigenous species.

We recently helped to relieve the hardware constraint by describing a microphone array that is affordable, portable, easy to use and commercially available. Here, we help to relieve the software constraint by developing an acoustic localization program called ""Sound Finder"", which is easy to use, freely available and accurate for a variety of animals and recording conditions. It runs in the free software environment R, and in spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel and the open-source software LibreOffice. In this study, we describe how Sound Finder functions, and then test its accuracy by localizing natural sounds that were broadcast through loudspeakers and re-recorded with microphone arrays. We quantify Sound Finder's accuracy by comparing its location estimates with known loudspeaker locations and with output from other localization approaches. We show that Sound Finder generates accurate location estimates for a variety of animal sounds, microphone array configurations and environmental conditions. Furthermore, Sound Finder generates an error value that allows the user to assess its accuracy. In conclusion, Sound Finder provides accurate estimates of a vocalizing animal's location.

Mean sperm density and absorbance at 350nm were 1.54e+10±4.95e+9sperm/mL and 1.91±0.22nm, respectively. Regression analysis demonstrated a highly significant positive relationship between sperm density and absorbance using a spectrophotometer at 350nm (R2=0.94, p<0.001, y=2.273e+10x-2.805e+10); significant but slightly weaker relationships were also detected at 400, 500, and 600nm (R2≤0.93, p<0.001). Fertilization success using sperm to egg ratios ranging from 1.3e+3 to 1.0e+6 sperm per egg increased from 37.5 to 68.1%, respectively. Sperm to egg ratio had a significant effect on fertilization success (p<0.0001), where fertilization success increased from 1.3e+3 to 2.5e+4 sperm per egg; adding greater than 2.5e+4 sperm per egg had no significant effect. Furthermore, the duration of time post-stripping had a significant effect on egg fertilization success (p<0.0001), such that between 0 and 10min post-stripping 57.4 to 78.2% of the eggs were fertilized while at 15min post-stripping a significant decrease in fertilization success was detected (47.5%). For all statistical models, the female variance component was significant for fertilization success (p<0.0001) and explained ≤84% of the models variance. In conclusion, European eel eggs should be fertilized within 10min post-stripping using 2.5e+4 sperm per egg. Together, these findings will contribute to the development of European eel breeding technology and further our understanding on sperm biology and reproductive biology in fishes. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial fertilization | Fertilization success | Gamete longevity | Spectrophotometer | Sperm density | Sperm to egg ratio,43,0,,245257,

Knowledge of white shark biology and ecology has increased recently based on research at known aggregation sites in the Indian, Atlantic, and Northeast Pacific Oceans; however, few data are available for the Northwest Pacific Ocean. This study provides a meta-analysis of 240 observations of white sharks from the Northwest Pacific Ocean between 1951 and 2012. Records comprise reports of bycatch in commercial fisheries, media accounts, personal communications, and documentation of shark-human interactions from Russia (n = 8), Republic of Korea (22), Japan (129), China (32), Taiwan (45), Philippines (1) and Vietnam (3). Observations occurred in all months, excluding October-January in the north (Russia and Republic of Korea) and July-August in the south (China, Taiwan, Philippines, and Vietnam). Population trend analysis indicated that the relative abundance of white sharks in the region has remained relatively stable, but parameterization of a 75% increase in observer effort found evidence of a minor decline since 2002. Reliably measured sharks ranged from 126- 602 cm total length (TL) and 16-2530 kg total weight. The largest shark in this study (602 cm TL) represents the largest measured shark on record worldwide. For all countries combined the sex ratio was non-significantly biased towards females (1:1.1; n = 113). Of 60 females examined, 11 were confirmed pregnant ranging from the beginning stages of pregnancy (egg cases) to near term (140 cm TL embryos). On average, 6.062.2 embryos were found per litter (maximum of 10) and gestation period was estimated to be 20 months. These observations confirm that white sharks are present in the Northwest Pacific Ocean year-round. While acknowledging the difficulties of studying little known populations of a naturally low abundance species, these results highlight the need for dedicated research to inform regional conservation and management planning.©2014 Christiansen et al.",,10,1,,undefined,

Using free-living female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) we experimentally reduced investment in current reproduction (number of offspring raised in the first brood) to examine whether baseline corticosterone (CORT) acted as a hormonal mediator preparing individuals for a predictable increase in future investment (number of offspring raised in the second brood). Although treatment and control birds raised the same total amount of offspring across two broods, the experimental birds increased reproductive investment in second broods to compensate for the reduced investment in the first brood. Data on both mean and intra-individual changes in baseline CORT support the idea that an increase in baseline CORT between the incubation stages in treatment birds strongly predicted this increase in investment. Importantly, we measured the increase in baseline CORT during late incubation prior to the increase in energetic demand associated with increased reproductive investment in offspring, indicating that flexible within-individual changes in baseline GCs can act as a labile mechanism preparing individuals for predictable increases in reproductive investment. As such, our experimental results indicate that elevated baseline GCs can prepare individuals for investment in energetically expensive life-history stages, rather than simply being elevated as a consequence of increased effort or demand. This suggests that short-term preparative increases in baseline GCs benefit individuals by successfully allowing them to maximize fitness under varying environmental conditions. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.",Corticosterone | European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) | Fitness | Phenotypic flexibility | Reaction norm | Reproductive investment,37,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Trophic position (TP) estimates from compound specific nitrogen isotopic analysis of amino acids (AA-CSIA) show promise as the method can disentangle confounding factors associated with changing δ15N values at the base of the food web, but it has yet to be tested in many organisms. This novel technique requires two empirically determined biological parameters: 1) β, the difference in δ15N values between glutamic acid (glu) and phenylalanine (phe) in primary producers and 2) trophic enrichment factor (TEF), the 15N enrichment of glu and phe at each trophic step. Values of β (3.4‰) and TEF (7.6‰) have been suggested for animals in aquatic environments; however recent observations indicate that TEF values may be variable, particularly among elasmobranchs where urea retention may alter nitrogen isotope fractionation between glu and phe. To test these uncertainties, we determined TEF values for three species of sharks, sand tiger (Carcharias taurus), lemon (Negaprion brevirostris), and leopard sharks (Triakis semifasciata), and one teleost species, opakapaka (Pristipomoides filamentosus) grown on controlled and well characterized diets for durations ranging from three (T. semifasciata) to over five years (P. filamentosus). TEF values for both elasmobranchs and opakapaka were ~2‰, significantly lower than TEFs previously reported. These results do not support the hypothesis that urea retention lowers 15N trophic enrichment between glu and phe in elasmobranchs. Rather, isotopic enrichment factors may be primarily driven by differences in dietary protein quality, leading to distinct TEFs for herbivores (~7.6‰) and carnivores (<7.6‰). We propose a method to calculate TP which integrates different TEF values for herbivores and carnivores. © 2014.",Amino acid | Crimson snapper | Elasmobranch | Stable isotope | Trophic enrichment factor | Trophic position,37,0,,OCE-1041329,National Science Foundation

Here we show that HLA-B-associated transcript 3 (BAT3) is essential for basal and starvation-induced autophagy in embryonic day 18.5 BAT3-/- mouse embryos and in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) through the modulation of p300-dependent acetylation of p53 and ATG7. Specifically, BAT3 increases p53 acetylation and proautophagic p53 target gene expression, while limiting p300-dependent acetylation of ATG7, a mechanism known to inhibit autophagy. In the absence of BAT3 or when BAT3 is located exclusively in the cytosol, autophagy is abrogated, ATG7 is hyperacetylated, p53 acetylation is abolished, and p300 accumulates in the cytosol, indicating that BAT3 regulates the nuclear localization of p300. In addition, the interaction between BAT3 and p300 is stronger in the cytosol than in the nucleus and, during starvation, the level of p300 decreases in the cytosol but increases in the nucleus only in the presence of BAT3. We conclude that BAT3 tightly controls autophagy by modulating p300 intracellular localization, affecting the accessibility of p300 to its substrates, p53 and ATG7.",Degradation | Nucleo-cytoplasmic shuttling | Signalisation,32,1,,undefined,

Elasmobranch vertebral centra can be serially sampled to obtain an isotopic history of an individual over ontogeny. The measured total δ13C value, however, may be misinterpreted due to the inclusion of the 13C-rich inorganic portion. Hydrochloric acid (HCl) is commonly used to remove the inorganic portion of hydroxyapatite structures before undertaking SIA, but more recently ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) has been recommended for elasmobranch vertebrae. These acid treatments may introduce uncertainty on measured δ13C and δ15N values above instrument precision and the effect of small sample size remains untested for elasmobranch vertebrae. METHODS Using a non-dilution program on an isotope ratio mass spectrometer the minimum sample weight of vertebrae required to obtain accurate isotopic values was determined for three shark species: white (Carcharodon carcharias), tiger (Galeocerdo cuvier), and sand tiger (Carcharias taurus). To examine if acid treatment completely removes the inorganic component of the vertebrae or whether the technique introduces its own uncertainty on measured δ13C and δ15N values, vertebrae samples were analyzed untreated and following EDTA treatment. RESULTS The minimum sample weight required for accurate stable isotope values and the percentage sample yield following EDTA treatment varied within and among species. After EDTA treatment, white shark vertebrae were all enriched in 13C and depleted in 15N, tiger shark vertebrae showed both enrichment and depletion of 13C and 15N, and sand tiger shark vertebrae were all depleted in 13C and 15N. CONCLUSIONS EDTA treatment of elasmobranch vertebrae produces unpredictable effects (i.e. non-linear and non-correctable) among species in both the percentage sample yield and the measured δ13C and δ15N values. Prior to initiating a large-scale study, we strongly recommend investigating (i) the minimum weight of vertebral material required to obtain consistent isotopic values and (ii) the effects of EDTA treatment, specific to the study species and the isotope ratio mass spectrometer employed.

Two critical requirements for individual recognition are the occurrence of characteristics that are unique to each individual, and the consistency of these characteristics through time. In some animals, characteristics of acoustic signals are known to vary over time due to changes in a variety of factors, including physiological and environmental features. Such temporal variation requires careful evaluation when exploring the individual distinctiveness of animal signals. In this study, we evaluate individual distinctiveness in the songs of male white-eared ground-sparrows Melozone leucotis and the persistence of distinctive characteristics over time. We collected focal recordings from populations of banded ground-sparrows during two consecutive breeding seasons, including multiple recording sessions within each breeding season. We evaluated individual distinctiveness in fine structural acoustic features of songs. We also extended our analysis to repertoire characteristics, focusing on whether the relative frequency of song type use may provide cues to individual identity. We found that each male white-eared ground-sparrow sang individually distinctive songs, although their fine structural features varied between recording sessions. We found the frequency with which males sang different song types was also individually distinctive, and this feature varied little between recording sessions. Receivers may be able to use these distinctive characteristics to differentiate individuals over extended time periods; this may be especially important for species that engage in long-term social interactions, such as tropical birds that defend territories against rival conspecific animals throughout the year. © 2014 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",Individual distinctiveness | Persistence over time | Repertoire | Songs | Structural acoustic features,7,0,,undefined,

This study presents a comprehensive review of how acoustic detection range has been considered and assessed to date, summarizes important variables to monitor when determining the detection range of a receiver array, and provides recommendations to account for detection range during experimental design, analysis and data interpretation. A total of 378 passive acoustic telemetry studies (1986-2012) were scored against a set of pre-defined criteria to provide a standardized assessment of how well detection range was accounted for, from a maximum possible score of 45. Scores ranged from 0 to 39 (11.1 ± 0.4; mean ± 1 SE). Over the past decade mean scores have been consistently between 6.7 and 12.9 which indicates that detection range has not been adequately considered in most contemporary acoustic telemetry studies. Given the highly variable nature of detection range over space and time, it is necessary to create a culture of detection range testing among the scientific community. For robust telemetry studies it is recommended that consideration of detection range should be given a greater focus within study design, execution and data analysis. To aid array design in new systems, short-term detection range tests should be conducted in the most representative area of the study system prior to deployment. As well, fixed distance sentinel tags should ideally be deployed at a representative receiver site within the array to provide a continuous assessment of detection range and influential environmental parameters should be monitored to facilitate modeling of detection range variability over time. When warranted, data analysis should incorporate modeled variation in detection ranges. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Acoustic telemetry | Animal movement | Detection range | Passive telemetry | Range test | Ultrasonic telemetry,112,0,,undefined,Adam Taliaferro Foundation

Alternatively, salmon can be propagated using outdoor semi-natural raceways that would provide the opportunity for both sexual and natural selection to act on offspring production. We performed a disease challenge on one-year-old smolts of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) to test the effects of breeding strategy and rearing environment on immune function. Farmed sexually mature salmon were bred following traditional aquaculture methods whereas others were allowed to spawn semi-naturally in outdoor spawning channels. The offspring were reared in their natal environment for six months when they were subjected to a reciprocal environment transplant and held for 5 additional months. Subsequently, fish were exposed to a Vibrio anguillarum waterborne challenge. A strong environmental effect on mortality was found for the hatchery-bred fish whereas the channel-bred fish showed no such response, perhaps indicative of a more canalized immune response. A two-way ANOVA resulted in a significant interaction between the breeding/early-rearing strategy and the reciprocal transplanted environment factors (F0.05, 1, 12=17.95, P<0.0012). In addition, humoral immune response measurements revealed a similar interaction between these two factors at 28 (P=0.0014) and 42days (P=0.0022). These results are indicative of genotype-by-environment interaction effects on the immune system of Chinook salmon. Remarkably, these effects were observed after only one round of sexual/natural selection using fish that have been under artificial selection for at least nine generations. The benefits of environmental canalization of the immune response may be an important advantage of channel-bred over hatchery-bred fish for the aquaculture industry. We suggest that introducing sexual/natural selection through mate choice via semi-natural spawning channels may lead to fish with more robust immune systems across changing environments. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial random mating | Disease challenge | Genotype-by-environment interactions | Mate choice | Rearing environment,3,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

We tested the hypothesis that SV cholesterol is required for proper sorting of SV proteins during recycling in live presynaptic terminals. We used the reversible block of endocytosis in the Drosophila temperature-sensitive dynamin mutant shibire-ts1 to trap exocytosed SV proteins, and then examined the effect of experimental treatments on the distribution of these proteins within the presynaptic plasma membrane by confocal microscopy. SV proteins synaptotagmin, vglut and csp were clustered following SV trapping in control experiments but dispersed in samples treated with the cholesterol chelator methyl-β-cyclodextrin to extract SV cholesterol. There was accumulation of phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP 2 ) in presynaptic terminals following SV trapping and this was reduced following SV cholesterol extraction. Reduced PIP 2 accumulation was associated with disrupted accumulation of actin in presynaptic terminals. Similar to vesicular cholesterol extraction, disruption of actin by latrunculin A after SV proteins had been trapped on the plasma membrane resulted in the dispersal of SV proteins and prevented recovery of synaptic transmission due to impaired endocytosis following relief of the endocytic block. Our results demonstrate that vesicular cholesterol is required for aggregation of exocytosed SV proteins in the presynaptic plasma membrane and are consistent with a mechanism involving regulation of PIP 2 accumulation and local actin polymerization by cholesterol. Thus, alteration of membrane or SV lipids may affect the ability of synapses to undergo sustained synaptic transmission by compromising the recycling of SV proteins. © 2013 The Physiological Society.",,17,0,CIHR,MOP-82827,Canadian Institutes of Health Research

L. Lockwood, P. Cassey and T. Blackburn (2009, Diversity and Distributions, 15, 904-910) first described a theoretical relationship between propagule pressure and colonization pressure, two empirical studies demonstrated that the transport stage of the invasion process can profoundly influence the strength of the relationship among multiple events, as well as predictions of introduction risk. However, studies exploring dynamics of transported communities are rare, as repeated-measures sampling during transportation by any vector is logistically difficult. We constructed a conceptual model of community dynamics during transportation and supported it by empirical data for propagule pressure and colonization pressure of plankton. Location: Global. Methods: A conceptual model of community dynamics was developed based on lognormal species abundance distribution and the simulation model of J. L. Lockwood, P. Cassey and T. Blackburn (2009, Diversity and Distributions, 15, 904-910). We considered four cases: case 'A' - no reduction in propagule nor colonization pressure; case 'B' - strong reduction in propagule and mild reduction in colonization pressure; case 'C' - mild reduction in propagule and strong reduction in colonization pressure; and case 'D' - strong reduction in both propagule and colonization pressures. Results: The cases 'B', 'C' and 'D' were supported by empirical data for invertebrates, dinoflagellates and diatoms from ships' ballast tanks, respectively. Propagule pressure of invertebrates, dinoflagellates and diatoms decreased 99.95%, 80% and 94% in 25 days, respectively, while colonization pressure decreased 34%, 57% and 64%. Main conclusions: Transport affects both propagule pressure and colonization pressure of taxa, with the magnitude of change dependent on length of transport and taxon-specific survival and reproduction. Our model demonstrates that introduction risk varies substantially across and within taxa depending on the occurrence and severity of selection pressures during transportation which serve to change species abundance distributions. © 2013 The Authors.",Biological invasion | Colonization pressure | Introduction risk | Propagule pressure,18,0,,undefined,

Nitrogen stable isotopes (δ15N) provide a powerful tool to estimate TP but are limited by a pragmatic assumption that isotope discrimination is constant (change in δ15N between predator and prey, Δ15N = 3.4‰), resulting in an additive framework that omits known Δ15N variation. Through meta-analysis, we determine narrowing discrimination from an empirical linear relationship between experimental Δ15N and δ15N values of prey consumed. The resulting scaled Δ15N framework estimated reliable TPs of zooplanktivores to tertiary piscivores congruent with known feeding relationships that radically alters the conventional structure of marine food webs. Apex predator TP estimates were markedly higher than currently assumed by whole-ecosystem models, indicating perceived food webs have been truncated and species-interactions over simplified.

The PLKs have been implicated in a variety of cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), with PLK1 typically overexpressed and PLKs 2-5 often downregulated. Altered expression of the PLKs in malignancy is often correlated with aberrant promoter methylation. Epigenetic marks are dynamic and can be modified in response to external environmental stimuli. The aim of our study was to determine if oxidative stress, a common feature of solid tumours, would induce changes to the promoter methylation of the PLKs resulting in changes in expression. We examined the promoter methylation status via MSP and subsequent expression levels of the PLK family members under exposure to hypoxic conditions or reactive oxygen species (ROS). Interestingly, murine embryonic fibroblasts exposed to hypoxia and ROS displayed significant hypermethylation of Plk1 and Plk4 promoter regions post treatment. Corresponding proteins were also depleted by 40% after treatment. We also examined the HCC-derived cell lines HepG2 and Hep3B and found that for PLK1 and PLK4, the increase in hypermethylation was correlated with the presence of functional p53. In p53 wild-type cells, HepG2, both PLK1 and PLK4 were repressed with treatment, while in the p53 null cell line, Hep3B, PLK4 protein was elevated in the presence of hypoxia and ROS. This was also the case for ROS-treated, p53 null, osteosarcoma cells, Saos-2, where the PLK4 promoter became hypomethylated and protein levels were elevated. Our data supports a model in which the PLKs are susceptible to epigenetic changes induced by microenvironmental cues and these modifications may be p53-dependent. This has important implications in HCC and other cancers, where epigenetic alterations of the PLKs could contribute to tumourigenesis and disease progression. © 2014 Ward, Hudson.",,10,1,,undefined,

We therefore quantified outbreeding effects in two generations (F1 hybrids and F2 backcrossed hybrids) of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) derived from captively-reared purebred lines that had been selectively bred for differential performance based on disease resistance and growth rate. Parental lines were crossed in 2009 to create purebred and reciprocal hybrid crosses (n = 53 families), and in 2010 parental and hybrid crosses were crossed to create purebred and backcrossed hybrid crosses (n = 66 families). Although we found significant genetic divergence between the parental lines (FST = 0.130), reciprocal F1 hybrids showed no evidence of outbreeding depression (hybrid breakdown) or favorable heterosis for weight, length, condition or survival. The F2 backcrossed hybrids showed no outbreeding depression for a suite of fitness related traits measured from egg to sexually mature adult life stages.

The goal of the current study was to evaluate the effectiveness of using gonadosomatic index (GSI) cut-off scores to classify reproductive status in male and female round goby by documenting associations between GSI, sex steroids, and gonad development. Gonadal stage was determined in both sexes using hematoxylin and eosin histology. Plasma 11-ketotestosterone and testosterone were measured in males, and testosterone and 17β-estradiol were measured in females. Gonadosomatic index cut-off scores were effective in selecting spawning capable individuals at higher GSI values, but GSI values were limited in the ability to make further distinctions of gonadal stage and missed many spawning capable females. In females, testosterone levels were highest during vitellogenic growth and declined prior to ovulation. 17β-estradiol displayed a similar, but non-statistically significant pattern. Males with developing testes had higher levels of 11-ketotestosterone -but not testosterone -than reproductively immature males, although levels of these androgens were overall positively correlated in males. The findings indicate that the conventional GSI cut-off scores (1% in males, 8% in females) accurately assign spawning capable condition in both sexes; however, they may also exclude some spawning capable females with lower GSIs. © 2013 International Association for Great Lakes Research.",11-Ketotestosterone | 17β-estradiol | Gonad development | Gonadosomatic index | Round goby | Testosterone,26,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

However, the relationship between these subspecies has not been studied using a modern taxonomic approach. In this study, our objective was to provide the first detailed taxonomic comparison between these three subspecies using an integrative multi-trait analysis. We analyzed morphometric features, qualitative plumage patterns, and quantitative plumage measurements using spectral reflectance from all three subspecies, and we analyzed vocalizations for subspecies M. b. biarcuata and M. b. cabanisi . Our results show that M. b. cabanisi can be readily distinguished from the two other subspecies on the basis of morphometrics (M. b. cabanisi are smaller), plumage patterns (M. b. cabanisi have different facial markings and plumage patches), color differences (M. b. cabanisi have plumage patches that differ in color and brightness), and vocalizations ( M. b. cabanisi have songs and calls that are acoustically distinct from those of M. b. biarcuata). By contrast, the two northern subspecies M. b. biarcuata and M. b. hartwegi were very similar for most traits, supporting previous suggestions that the two northern subspecies should be considered a single subspecies. Our data reveal that the differentiation in phenotypic characteristics between M. b. cabanisi versus M. b. biarcuata and M. b. hartwegi is similar to that reported for other complexes of subspecies where species status has been recognized. We argue that M. b. cabanisi should be treated as a species separate from M. biarcuata and propose that it be called Melozone cabanisi, White-faced Ground-sparrow. Our findings will contribute to the conservation efforts of the White-faced Ground-sparrow, which is endemic to Costa Rica's Central Valley and Turrialba Valley, by bringing focus to conservation policies that preserve ground-sparrow habitat (thickets, shade coffee plantations, and young secondary forest).",Color differences | Emberizidae | Ground-sparrows | Melozone biarcuata | Melozone cabanisi | Morphology | Plumage patterns | Vocalizations,7,0,CFI,undefined,Canada Foundation for Innovation

The present study examined the relative contributions of chemical hydrophobicity (octanol-water partition coefficient [KOW]) and habitat use as factors regulating variability in polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) congener bioaccumulation in 3 lower trophic level cyprinid species across spatial and temporal scales. Bluntnose minnows (Pimephales notatus), spottail shiners (Notropis hudsonius), and emerald shiners (Notropis atherinoides) were sampled at 3 locations in the Detroit River, Ontario, Canada. Variability in PCB concentration was evaluated with respect to several factors, including chemical hydrophobicity, site, season, species, and weight using sum of squares and Levene's test of homogeneity of variance. Individual variability in bioaccumulated congener-specific residues depended on chemical hydrophobicity with mid- and high-range KOW congeners (logKOW>6.0), demonstrating the highest amount of variance compared with low KOW congeners. Different feeding strategies also contributed to the variance observed for mid-range KOW congeners among species. In the present study, benthic feeding specialists exhibited lower variance in PCB concentrations compared with the 2 generalist species. The results indicate that chemical hydrophobicity and feeding ecology not only contribute to differences in the biomagnification potentials of fish, but also regulate between-individual variation in PCB concentrations both across and within fish species.

Here, we test the PCR efficiency and biodiversity recovery potential of three commonly used genetic markers - nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA (18S), mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S ribosomal RNA (mt16S) - using 454 pyrosequencing of a zooplankton community collected from Hamilton Harbour, Ontario. We found that biodiversity detection power and PCR efficiency varied widely among these markers. All tested primers for COI failed to provide high-quality PCR products for pyrosequencing, but newly designed primers for 18S and 16S passed all tests. Furthermore, multiple analyses based on large-scale pyrosequencing (i.e. 1/2 PicoTiter plate for each marker) showed that primers for 18S recover more (38 orders) groups than 16S (10 orders) across all taxa, and four vs. two orders and nine vs. six families for Crustacea. Our results showed that 18S, using newly designed primers, is an efficient and powerful tool for profiling biodiversity in largely unexplored communities, especially when amplification difficulties exist for mitochondrial markers such as COI. Universal primers for higher resolution markers such as COI are still needed to address the possible low resolution of 18S for species-level identification. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",454 pyrosequencing | Aquatic community | Cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) | Efficiency test | Mitochondrial 16S ribosomal RNA (mt16S) | Small subunit ribosomal DNA (18S),52,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Some birds produce repertoires consisting of hundreds of songs while others produce a single song type. For species with a single-song repertoire, there are varying levels of inter-individual variation which can be the result of environmental, genetic, and physiological factors. Male Snow Buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis) typically produce a single song type, and while syllable sharing occurs between individuals, many researchers have anecdotally noted the individuality of each male's song. To investigate this long-held assertion, we performed a detailed bioacoustic analysis of male Snow Buntings recorded in the Canadian Arctic. We use canonical discriminant analysis to provide quantitative evidence confirming that male Snow Buntings sing individually distinctive songs. Furthermore, we present the first evidence that some Snow Buntings exhibit inter-annual variation in song structure; while songs remain consistent within each year, two males changed their song type between years. Inter-individual variation in song content can have important behavioral implications, because it facilitates individual recognition and can affect individual fitness. © 2014 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.",Individual distinctiveness | Individual recognition | Inter-annual variation | Plectrophenax nivalis | Snow Bunting | song,1,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Here, we describe a method to extract vesicular cholesterol using a temperature-sensitive Drosophila dynamin mutant, shibire-ts1 (shi), to trap SVs on the plasma membrane. Trapped SVs are more accessible to cholesterol extraction by the cholesterol chelator, methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD). This method can likely be extended to extract other lipids from SVs and could also be used to add lipids.

In this study, a custom-designed microphone array was used to collect landscape-scale recordings of the acoustic signaling behavior of Common Loons (Gavia immer) along a 10-km transect spanning three lakes in eastern Ontario, Canada. Recordings were collected during the early part of the breeding season during two consecutive years (2008-2009). Analyses focused on understanding how the vocal output of Common Loons varied with time of day, time of year, and in response to variation in weather. Common Loons showed significant diel variation in vocal output, producing more wail, yodel, and tremolo calls at night than during the day. Common Loons showed significant seasonal variation in vocal output, producing fewer wail, yodel, and tremolo calls as the first month of the breeding season progressed. Common Loons showed significant differences in vocal behavior with changing weather conditions, producing more calls at cold temperatures, with low wind speed and air pressure, and when rain was light or absent. Microphone array recordings were used to estimate signal transmission properties of Common Loon vocalizations, demonstrating that wail, yodel, and tremolo calls transmit significantly farther at night than during the day. These results provide quantitative details of Common Loon vocal signaling strategies, revealing that this species calls when abiotic conditions are ideal for long-range signaling.",Acoustic monitoring | active signal space | Common Loon | diel variation | Gavia immer | microphone array | seasonal variation | signaling strategies | sound transmission | vocalizations,3,0,,undefined,

Sodium salicylate (SS) is a widely used medication with side effects on hearing. In order to understand these side effects, we recorded sound-driven local-field potentials in a neural structure, the dorsal cortex of the inferior colliculus (ICd). Using a microiontophoretic technique, we applied SS at sites of recording and studied how auditory responses were affected by the drug. Furthermore, we studied how the responses were affected by combined local application of SS and an agonists/antagonist of the type-A or type-B γ-aminobutyric acid receptor (GABA<inf>A</inf> or GABA<inf>B</inf> receptor). Results revealed that SS applied alone enhanced auditory responses in the ICd, indicating that the drug had local targets in the structure. Simultaneous application of the drug and a GABAergic receptor antagonist synergistically enhanced amplitudes of responses. The synergistic interaction between SS and a GABAA receptor antagonist had a relatively early start in reference to the onset of acoustic stimulation and the duration of this interaction was independent of sound intensity. The interaction between SS and a GABAB receptor antagonist had a relatively late start, and the duration of this interaction was dependent on sound intensity. Simultaneous application of the drug and a GABAergic receptor agonist produced an effect different from the sum of effects produced by the two drugs released individually. These differences between simultaneous and individual drug applications suggest that SS modified GABAergic inhibition in the ICd. Our results indicate that SS can affect sound-driven activity in the ICd by modulating local GABAergic inhibition.",Auditory system | GABA&lt;inf&gt;A&lt;/inf&gt; receptor | GABA&lt;inf&gt;B&lt;/inf&gt; receptor | Hearing | Microiontophoresis | Midbrain | Tinnitus,6,1,,undefined,

Long-tailed Manakins (Chiroxiphia linearis) exhibit an exploded lek-breeding system wherein two unrelated males cooperate to perform complex courtship displays for females. Our objectives in this study were to fully characterize the courtship display of Long-tailed Manakins, to evaluate the sequence and stereotypy of the display, and to investigate specific predictors of copulation success. Whereas the display of Long-tailed Manakins has traditionally been divided into two major parts, the hopping display and the butterfly display, we identified and characterized 16 individual display elements within these larger components of the display. We also determined that some aspects of the display are highly structured and stereotypical in performance, such that certain elements of the display are highly likely to be preceded or followed by particular elements. Nevertheless, other aspects of the display were much more flexible in terms of element sequence. We also found that the length and rate of performance of individual display elements were highly variable across displays. We therefore evaluated whether individual elements of the display could predict courtship success. Our results show that a number of highly correlated elements, namely upright postures, bounces, angel flights, and bows, can predict whether a display ends in copulation with a female. This research enhances our understanding of male display behaviour and female choice in Long-tailed Manakins, and may shed some light on the evolution of complex courtship displays in birds. © 2014 Dt.

Long-tailed manakins (Chiroxiphia linearis) exhibit an exploded lek-breeding system wherein the two top-ranking males at each display site team up to perform elaborate coordinated courtship displays for females. Young males undergo delayed plumage maturation whereby they acquire distinct pre-definitive plumage patterns each year until they attain definitive plumage in their fifth year. This unique characteristic is thought to have evolved as a status-signalling mechanism to aid in the establishment of an age-graded dominance hierarchy in which older males are dominant to younger males. Previous research has shown evidence for such a dominance hierarchy among alpha and beta males; however, the presence of this hierarchy among males of other age classes has never been quantified. In this study, we investigated the presence of an age-graded dominance hierarchy by determining whether older males direct more aggressive behaviours towards younger males. We also investigated whether status signalling is less clear within age classes than between age classes, by determining whether males within the same age class exhibit more aggression towards each other. We found that older males performed aggressive behaviours towards younger males much more frequently than younger males performed aggressive behaviours towards older males. We also found that some aggressive interactions occurred between males within the same age class more frequently than between males from different age classes. Our study provides some evidence for an age-graded dominance hierarchy among male long-tailed manakins of all age classes and also provides some support for the status-signalling hypothesis. However, further research is needed to conclusively establish the presence of a linear dominance hierarchy among younger male manakins.

As the mechanisms leading to variation in carotenoid- and melanin-based plumage differ fundamentally, these systems may not be ideal to assess the condition-dependence of melanin signals. Instead, we hypothesized that melanin-plumage is more likely to signal condition in purely achromatic species. We performed a meta-analysis reviewing evidence for condition-dependent melanic plumage: we compared the net effect size for the relationship between melanin traits and condition in species that are achromatic versus species that also display a carotenoid-based trait. Our results indicate that melanin plumage is condition-dependent in species of both plumage types. Contrarily to our prediction, this finding suggests that melanin ornament condition-dependence is not conditional on the context of other ornaments within a species.

We found that solo songs and duets in this species showed an acoustic structure intermediate to other northern and southern Melozone groundsparrows. Patterns of repertoire-use in male solo songs were highly similar between males holding nearby territories, suggesting that song learning may occur after territory establishment. The diel pattern for output of calls and solo songs showed a pronounced peak early in the morning, indicative of dawnchorus singing behaviour.

Given that Lake Erie may represent an ecological barrier to migratory birds, we predicted that mainland and island sites would show different patterns in both the number of passage migrants and the timing of their migration. Analysis of over 60 000 flight calls from 6200 h of recordings revealed significantly more migrants over the island than the mainland in both spring and fall 2012.

In this study, we provide the first detailed analysis of the vocal behaviour of the Brown-throated Wren (Troglodytes brunneicollis), a neotropical songbird found in oak forests in the highlands of Mexico and the southwestern United States. We quantify the fine structural characteristics of the song, and describe the size and structure of the song repertoire. Further, we describe diel variation, analyze song-sharing patterns among neighbors, and explore whether this species uses syntactical rules for creating their songs. Our analyses reveal that Brown-throated Wrens have complex songs and simple calls. They sing with eventual variety, repeating songs many times before switching to a new song type. Males combine syllables into phrases to create songs. We show that song repertoire size is not fixed; birds recombine their syllables to produce highly variable song types. Brown-throated Wrens sing with high vocal output after sunrise and song activity declines throughout the morning. Song sharing shows no variation with distance among our sampled individuals. We divide the syllables in Brown-throated Wren songs into 13 categories; birds sing some syllables more frequently than others, and some syllables are more likely to be found at the beginning, middle, or end of the song. Transitions between syllable categories deviate significantly from random chance, and most males analyzed follow similar patterns of syllable transitions, revealing syntactical structure.

They repeat a song type several times before switching to a different one, with some variation in the number of times they repeat specific elements.

The objective of the current study was to investigate variability in overall brain size and particular brain regions of male Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) through the evaluation of potential driving forces - environment and reproductive morph. By comparing fish from different rearing environments and different male reproductive morphs (hooknose versus jack), the current research assessed the influence of each of these factors on overall brain size and on select brain regions. Male hooknose salmon had relatively smaller brains, once corrected for body size, than male jack salmon, suggesting possible trade-offs between somatic and brain development. Fish reared in hatchery environments but released into the wild as presmolts still had relatively larger brains than their wild counterparts, despite sharing wild habitats for over 3 years, suggesting persistent effects of hatchery rearing. Taken together, these results show that the difference in reproductive morphs can substantially impact brain morphology and that short-term environmental influences can have persistent effects throughout ontogeny.",,4,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Currently accepted paradigms in ecology dictate that disturbances at all temporal scales exert a significant influence on community structure and ecosystem stability. Microbial community resistance and resilience to perturbations are largely dependent on the physiological flexibility and taxonomic richness of the pre-perturbation community. Can a microbial community dominated by late-successional endemic taxa exhibit resistance and/or functional redundancy? In this study, intact littoral epilithic diatom communities from an ancient, tropical lake were exposed to oxygenated, filtered hypolimnetic water to simulate a lake upwelling event. Filtered lake surface water was used as a control. Discriminant function models based on changes in density and relative abundance of taxa after both treatments assigned samples to their correct treatment groups 100% of the time. A change in relative abundance of taxa between the two treatments indicated that competitive outcomes varied with a shift in the water chemistry, with different taxa exhibiting positive, negative, or neutral numerical responses. These results suggest that highly endemic diatom communities can maintain community function through shifts in competitive dynamics. We conclude that condition-specific competition models can be invoked to explain diatom community dynamics despite the inability of diatoms to use behavior to respond to changes in the abiotic environment.",Ancient lakes | Community ecology | Diatoms | Disturbance | Lake Matano | Sulawesi,3,0,,undefined,

We measured stable isotopes of carbon (δ13C) and nitrogen (δ15N) and fatty acid profiles in Lake Ontario alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus), rainbow smelt (Osmerus mordax), slimy sculpin (Cottus cognatus) and round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) collected from 1982 to 2008 to investigate how temporal variability in these ecological tracers can relate to ecosystem-level changes associated with the establishment of highly invasive dreissenid mussels. 2. Prey fish δ15N values remained relatively constant, with only slimy sculpin exhibiting a temporal increase in δ15N. In contrast, δ13C values for alewife, rainbow smelt and, especially, slimy sculpin became less negative over time and were consistent with the benthification of the Lake Ontario food web associated with dreissenids. 3. Principal components analysis revealed higher contributions of 14:0 and 16:1n-7 fatty acids and increasingly negative δ13C values in older samples in agreement with the greater historical importance of pelagic production for alewife, rainbow smelt and slimy sculpin. 4. Temporal declines in fatty acid unsaturation indices and Σn-3/Σn-6 ratios, and also increased 24:0/14:0 ratios for alewife, rainbow smelt and slimy sculpin, indicated the increasing importance of nearshore production pathways for more recently collected fish and resulted in values more similar to those for round goby. 5.

Ornithologen-Gesellschaft e.V. 2014. The avian dawn chorus is a daily period of high song output performed predominantly during the breeding season. Dawn chorus performance varies at both the individual and species level. The many extrinsic factors that may relate to dawn chorus start times for different North American bird species have received little attention. In this study, we consider relationships between dawn chorus start times and ambient temperature, precipitation, cloud cover, lunar phase, and Julian date for six common bird species living in a northern temperate rural area. Overall, birds began singing earlier with full or third quarter moon (when moonlight is present at dawn) and with increasing temperature at nautical twilight, and birds began singing later with the presence of cloud cover and precipitation. Our results indicate that a different suite of environmental factors influenced the chorus start times of different species and to different degrees. Alder flycatchers begin singing earliest in this group of birds, followed by Song Sparrows, White-throated Sparrows, American Robins, Eastern Phoebes, and Black-capped Chickadees. This investigation reveals that extrinsic abiotic factors have a significant effect on the dawn chorus start times of north temperate birds, and represents the first comprehensive study of dawn chorus start time variation in North American birds.",Ambient light | Animal behavior | Dawn chorus | Phenology of song | Temperate birds | Weather,21,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

Songbirds rely on acoustic signals for mate choice and territory defense, and masking of these signals can have negative fitness consequences. Prior investigations reveal that birds mitigate the negative effects of acoustic masking by increasing their signal amplitude or by singing with higher minimum frequencies. In this study, we evaluate the responses of male Pacific Wrens (Troglodytes pacificus) to natural ambient noise (ocean surf) and anthropogenic noise (highway traffic) in Pacific Rim National Park Reserve, B.C., Canada. Pacific Wrens, known for their complex songs, are specialists of old-growth forest. We hypothesized that Pacific Wrens would compensate for the effects of ambient noise in their environments through modifications to their songs that enhanced their transmission properties. Recognizing that longer, higher frequency, and more complex signals propagate better in noisy environments, we predicted that Pacific Wrens would increase the length of their songs, the length of the syllables within their songs, the number of syllables per song, and the minimum frequency of their songs. Recordings of 52 territorial Pacific Wrens showed that proximity to highway traffic noise had a significant effect on song duration but no significant effect on any of the other measured variables. Pacific Wrens that were recorded near the shoreline, however, sang songs with longer syllables, and higher intra-individual variation in song duration. Number of syllables, syllable minimum frequency, and song duration did not vary with distance from the shoreline. We conclude that natural and anthropogenic noise sources influence the singing behavior of Pacific Wrens. © 2014 by the Wilson Ornithological Society.",Acoustic masking | Bird song | Noise | Pacific Wren | Signal transmission | Troglodytes pacificus,8,0,CFI,undefined,Canada Foundation for Innovation

However, most studies have reported significant variation in successional patterns, particularly among replicate carcasses, which has complicated estimates of PMIs. Several forensic entomology researchers have proposed that further integration of ecological and evolutionary theory in forensic entomology could help advance the application of succession data for producing PMI estimates. The purpose of this essay is to draw attention to the role of spatial aggregation of arthropods among carrion resources as a potentially important aspect to consider for understanding and predicting the assembly of arthropods on carrion over time. We review ecological literature related to spatial aggregation of arthropods among patchy and ephemeral resources, such as carrion, andwhenpossible integrate these results with published forensic literature. We show that spatial aggregation of arthropods across resources is commonly reported and has been used to provide fundamental insight for understanding regional and local patterns of arthropod diversity and coexistence. Moreover, two suggestions are made for conducting future research. First, because intraspecific aggregation affects species frequency distributions across carcasses, data from replicate carcasses should not be combined, but rather statistically quantified to generate occurrence probabilities. Second, we identify a need for studies that tease apart the degree to which community assembly on carrion is spatially versus temporally structured, which will aid in developing mechanistic hypotheses on the ecological factors shaping community assembly on carcasses. © 2014 Entomological Society of America.",ecological theory | forensic entomology | resource partitioning | spatial aggregation | succession,17,0,,undefined,

We focus on the prediction and analysis of obligate and non-obligate SCF-ligase complexes by using sequence domains from the Pfam database. After extracting different types of feature vectors, the prediction is performed via a support vector machine (SVM). The numerical results demonstrate that most of the interactions of SCF-ligase complexes are mediated by at least one domain. Moreover, domain-domain interactions dominate in obligate complexes whereas non-obligate complexes exhibit more domain-peptide chain interactions. Also, the computational results show that the best prediction accuracy of 80.46% is achieved using the combination of feature vectors of domain-domain type, domain-peptide chain type and no-domain interactions.",Complex type prediction | Pfam domains | Protein-protein interaction | SCF-ligases,2,0,,undefined,

A comprehensive synthesis of data from empirically based published studies and a widely used stormwater best management practice (BMP) database were used to assess the variability in nitrogen (N) removal performance of urban stormwater ponds, wetlands, and swales and to identify factors that may explain this variability. While the data suggest that BMPs were generally effective on average, removal efficiencies of ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3), and total nitrogen (TN) were highly variable ranging from negative (i.e., BMPs acting as sources of N) to 100%. For example, removal of NO3 varied from (median ±1 SD) -15 ± 49% for dry ponds, 32 ± 120% for wet ponds, 58 ± 210% for wetlands, and 37 ± 29% for swales. Across the same BMP types, TN removal was 27 ± 24%, 40 ± 31%, 61 ± 30%, and 50 ± 29%. NH4 removal was 9 ± 36%, 29 ± 72%, 31 ± 24%, and 45 ± 34%. BMP size, age, and location explained some of the variability. For example, small and shallow ponds and wetlands were more effective than larger, deeper ones in removing N. Despite well-known intra-annual variation in N fluxes, most measurements have been made over short time periods using concentrations, not flow-weighted N fluxes. Urban N export is increasing in some areas as large storms become more frequent. Thus, accounting for the full range of BMP performance under such conditions is crucial. A select number of long-term flux-based BMP studies that rigorously measure rainfall, hydrology, and site conditions could improve BMP implementation.",Best management practices | Constructed wetland | Detention pond | Nitrogen removal | Nutrients | Performance | Retention basin | Stormwater management | Urban areas | Vegetated swale,40,0,NSF,DBI-1052875,National Science Foundation

Significant temporal declines in energy densities were observed for all three species, and significant declines were found for lake trout size-at-age and herring gull egg sizes. For lake trout and herring gulls, these declines occurred during a period of reduced abundance of pelagic forage fish and increased inclusion of terrestrial food in diets of herring gulls.

In response to acoustic interference, some animals can improve signalling efficacy by altering the structure of their signals. In this study, we played artificial noise to 46 male spring peepers Pseudacris crucifer, on their breeding grounds, and tested whether the noise affected the duration, call rate, and peak frequency of their advertisement calls. We used two experimental noise treatments that masked either the high- or low-frequency components of an average advertisement call; this allowed us to evaluate whether frogs adaptively shift the peak frequency of their calls away from both types of interference. Our playback treatments caused spring peepers to produce shorter calls, and the high-frequency noise treatment caused them to lower the frequency of their calls immediately after the noise ceased. Call rate did not change in response to playback. Consistent with previous studies, ambient temperature was inversely related to call duration and positively related to call rate. We conclude that noise affects the structure of spring peeper advertisement calls, and that spring peepers therefore have a mechanism for altering signal structure in response to noise. Future studies should test if other types of noise, such as biotic or anthropogenic noise, have similar effects on call structure, and if the observed changes to call structure enhance or impair communication in noisy environments. © 2014 Current Zoology.",Acoustic communication | Animal communication | Anurans | Frequency | Song structure,10,1,,undefined,

Duet timing is dependent upon each animal's attentiveness to its partner and its ability or motivation to cooperate, and therefore precise coordination of duet elements could be an important signal to territorial rivals. We used a playback experiment to test the hypothesis that territorial animals distinguish between highly coordinated duets, poorly coordinated duets and alternating solos. We studied three related species of wrens that show natural variation in the coordination of their male and female songs: banded wrens, Thryophilus pleurostictus, occasionally perform loosely coordinated duets but more commonly sing solo songs; rufous-and-white wrens, Thryophilus rufalbus, regularly perform loosely coordinated duets; and plain wrens, Cantorchilus modestus, regularly perform highly coordinated duets. We used stereo duet playback to simulate highly coordinated duets, poorly coordinated duets, alternating solos and a heterospecific control. We played back these four treatments to 63 territorial pairs of wrens. Responses to experimental treatments were stronger than responses to control treatments. Response to the three experimental treatments varied among species. Banded wrens responded more strongly to both types of duets than to alternating solos, in terms of closest approach and number of passes over the speaker. Rufous-and-white wrens responded more intensely to alternating solos and coordinated duets than to uncoordinated duets, in terms of closest approach, number of passes over the speaker and number of songs initiated. Plain wrens responded most intensely to alternating solos in terms of closest approach, and no less intensely to alternating solos than to the other treatments in terms of other measures of response. Together, our results indicate that these three species of wrens distinguish between coordinated duets, uncoordinated duets and alternating solos. However, highly coordinated duets do not incite categorically stronger responses than uncoordinated duets or alternating solos in any of these species. © 2014 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Duet | Duet coordination | Duet timing | Female behaviour | Territoriality | Tropical behaviour | Wren,13,0,AOU,undefined,Animal Behavior Society

These calls are commonly used for both within- and between-group communication in many bird and primate species. In the Neotropics, mated pairs of socially monogamous titi monkeys (genus Callicebus) emit conspicuous, coordinated loud calls. These vocalizations appear to play a role in territorial defense, a hypothesis derived from studies of only three of the 31 recognized Callicebus species. Here, we describe the acoustic properties and organization of the loud calls of black-fronted titi monkeys (Callicebus nigrifrons). We compare the behavioral and ecological contexts associated with these vocalizations to investigate their role in within- and between-group communication, resource defense, and mate defense. Black-fronted titi monkeys create loud calls by combining a finite number of syllables to form more complex phrases, which are assembled to compose long sequences of loud calls. Bioacoustic features distinguish the loud calls used in different contexts, involving communication within- and between-groups. We found support for the hypothesis that vocalizations used for between-group communication are cooperative displays used by the mated pair and other group members to regulate access to important food resources, such as fruits. On the other hand, we only found weak support for the mate defense hypothesis. Am. J.

In trill production, vocal tract mechanics impose a tradeoff between syllable repetition rate and frequency bandwidth, with the trade-off most pronounced at higher values of both parameters. Available evidence suggests that trills that simultaneously maximize both traits are more threatening to males or more attractive to females, consistent with a history of sexual selection favoring highperformance trills. Here, we identify a sampling limitation that confounds the detection and description of performance trade-offs. We reassess 70 data sets (from 26 published studies) and show that sampling limitations afflict 63 of these to some degree. Traditional upper-bound regression, which does not control for sampling limitations, detects performance trade-offs in 33 data sets; yet when sampling limitations are controlled, performance trade-offs are detected in only 15. Sampling limitations therefore confound more than half of all performance trade-offs reported using the traditional method. An alternative method that circumvents this sampling limitation, which we explore here, is quantile regression. Our goal is not to question the presence of mechanical trade-offs on trill production but rather to reconsider how these trade-offs can be detected and characterized from acoustic data. © 2013 by The University of Chicago.",Birdsong | Correlated evolution | Quantile regression | Tradeoff | Trill | Upper-bound regression,30,0,,undefined,

Species richness and abundance are two commonly measured parameters used to characterize invasion risk associated with transport vectors, especially those capable of transferring large species assemblages. Understanding the relationship between these two variables can further improve our ability to predict future invasions by identifying conditions where high-risk (i.e. species-rich or high abundance or both) and low-risk (i.e. species-poor and low abundance) introduction events are expected. While ballast water is one of the best characterized transport vectors of aquatic non-indigenous species, very few studies have assessed its magnitude at high latitudes. We assessed the arrival potential of zooplankton via ballast water in the Canadian Arctic by examining species richness, total abundance, and the relationship between the two parameters for zoo plankton in ships from Europe destined for the Arctic, in comparison with the same parameters for ships bound for Atlantic Canada and the Great Lakes. In addition, we examined whether species richness and/or total abundance were influenced by temperature change and/or ballast water age for each shipping route. We found that species richness and total abundance for Arctic and Great Lakes ships were significantly lower than those for Atlantic ships. Differences in species richness and total abundance for ships utilizing different shipping routes were mostly related to ballast water age. A significant species richness-total abundance relationship for Arctic and Great Lakes ships suggests that these parameters decreased proportionately as ballast water aged. In contrast, the absence of such a relationship for Atlantic ships suggests that decreases in total abundance were accompanied by little to no reduction in species richness. Collectively, our results indicate that the arrival potential of zooplankton in ballast water of Arctic ships may be lower than or similar to that of Atlantic and Great Lakes ships, respectively.",Biological invasions | Colonization pressure | Invasion pathway | Invasive species | Propagule pressure | Shipping vector,7,1,DFO,undefined,Fisheries and Oceans Canada

Thirteen potential invaders were sampled from ballast water, while 26 taxa sampled from St. Lawrence River ports are not reported from the Great Lakes. The majority of NIS recorded in samples are marine species with low potential for survival in the Great Lakes, however two euryhaline species (copepod Oithona similis, and amphipod Gammarus palustris) and two taxa reported from brackish waters (copepod Microsetella norvegica and decapod Cancer irroratus) may pose a risk for invasion. In addition, four marine NIS were collected in freshwater samples indicating that at least a subset of marine species have potential as new invaders to the Great Lakes.

Gravid females of the common green bottle fly, Lucilia sericata Meigen (Diptera: Calliphoridae), readily locate recently deceased vertebrates as oviposition sites, particularly when these animals have been injured. We investigated semiochemical and visual cues that mediate attraction of gravid females to fresh rat carrion. Female flies were more strongly attracted to incised rat carrion than to intact carrion. They were also attracted to Porapak Q headspace volatile (HSV) extract of incised rat carrion. Analyzing aliquots of Porapak Q HSV extract by gas chromatographic-electroantennographic detection revealed nine components [phenol, para- and/or meta-cresol (could not be separated), guaiacol, dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), phenylacetaldehyde, (E)-2-octenal, nonanal, and tetramethyl pyrazine] that consistently elicited responses from blow fly antennae. In laboratory experiments, a synthetic blend of these nine components was as attractive to gravid females as Porapak Q HSV extract, but blend attractiveness was due entirely to DMTS. In both laboratory and field experiments, increasing doses of DMTS attracted increasingly more flies. Coupled with DMTS, carrion-type color cues (dark red, black) were more effective than bright color cues (white, yellow) in attracting flies. In field experiments, dark traps baited with DMTS captured a total of 214 calliphorid flies (200 L. sericata, 10 Lucilia illustris Meigen, three Calliphora vicina Robineau-Desvoidy, one Calliphora vomitoria L.), all of which were gravid females. These results support the conclusion that DMTS and dark color represent a bimodal cue complex that signifies suitable oviposition sites to gravid calliphorid females, particularly L. sericata.",Blow flies | Calliphoridae | Carrion | Dimethyl trisulfide | Diptera | Egg-laying site | GC-EAD | Lucilia sericata | Semiochemical,20,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

All rights reserved. Physiological mechanisms underlying migration remain poorly understood, but recent attention has focused on the role of the glucocorticoid hormone corticosterone (CORT) as a key endocrine regulator of migration. The migrationmodulation hypothesis (MMH) proposes that baseline plasma CORT levels are elevated in migratory birds to facilitate hyperphagia and lipogenesis and that further elevation of CORT in response to acute stress is suppressed. Consequently, CORT may be a poor indicator of individual condition or environmental variation in migratory birds. We tested the MMH by measuring baseline and stress-induced CORT in common yellowthroats (Geothlypis trichas) during fall migration over 2 consecutive years in the Revelstoke Reach drawdown zone, a migratory stopover site affected by local hydroelectric operations. Birds had low baseline CORT at initial capture (!5 ng/mL) and then showed a robust stress response, with CORT increasing to ca. 50 ng/ mL within 10-20 min. Our data therefore do not support the MMH. Baseline CORT did not vary with body mass, time of capture, Julian day, or year, suggesting that variable flooding regimes did not affect baseline CORT. Individual variation in the rate of increase in CORT was correlated with Julian day, being higher later in the migration period. Our data suggest that plasma CORT can be a useful metric in migration studies.",,4,0,,undefined,

Climate change and increasing exploitation of resources are threats to Arctic marine species. Knowledge of vertical and horizontal movements of species is critical to understand their spatial ecology to inform effective ecosystem-based management. Recently, Arctic skate Am bly - raja hyperborea, a largely unstudied, cold water, deep-dwelling species has become a common bycatch species in groundfish fisheries throughout the Arctic. To investigate Arctic skate movement, depth and temperature preferences, 9 adults were tagged with pop-off archival transmitting tags in Cumberland Sound, Canadian Arctic, in August 2010 and August 2011 for 40 to 100 d. Of the 9 individuals tagged, 5 transmitted reliable data to satellites. Arctic skate occupied waters between 1.2 and 2.9°C (2.5 ± 0.1°C; mean ± SD) and 317 and 1355 m (944 ± 154 m). Tags popped off within a 37 km straight-line distance from the tagging location, indicating limited horizontal dispersal during the pre-ice formation period of late summer and early winter. Although mixedeffect models indicated that occupied depth varied with the diel cycle, the relationship was weak and depth variation was small, suggesting diel vertical migration does not appear to be a common strategy. Activity levels, estimated from detailed time series depth profiles, indicated multiple behaviours from resting to large depth changes (>150 m per 0.5 h). Given the levels of bycatch of this species in developing Arctic fisheries, overlap in habitat with the commercially valuable Greenland halibut Reinhardtius hippoglossoides and historical declines of skate populations, it is recommended that the IUCN Red List designation of 'Least Concern' for the Arctic skate be re-evaluated.",Archival tags | Arctic | Bycatch | Fisheries | Movement | Rajidae,6,1,,undefined,

For the Canadian waters of the Great Lakes, toxaphene causes minor restrictions only in Lake Superior, i.e., 3% of the total (restrictive. +. unrestrictive) advisories issued. However, the significance of the hazard posed by toxaphene in fish is not clear since more restrictive advisories due to other priority contaminants may be masking the less restrictive advisories. We simulated fish consumption advisories for the Toxaphene-only scenario by neglecting the presence of contaminants other than toxaphene, and compared with the issued advisories as well as with the published simulated Mercury-only scenario. Restrictive advisories under the Toxaphene-only scenario compared to the issued toxaphene related advisories would increase from 3% to 14%, <. 1% to 4%, and 0% to 2% for Lakes Superior, Huron and Ontario, respectively, and remain at 0% for Lake Erie. For Lake Superior, most of the restrictive Toxaphene-only advisories would be for fatty fish. Overall, the Toxaphene-only advisories would be significantly less restrictive compared to the issued advisories, and also generally less restrictive compared to the Mercury-only scenario. These results suggest that toxaphene is less of a concern than PCBs (including dioxin-like PCBs), dioxins-furans and mercury from the perspective of health risk to humans consuming Great Lakes fish; elevated toxaphene is mainly a concern for human consumers of Lake Superior fatty fish.

We present extensions to an existing behavioral agent-based model (ABM) to use as an inverse modeling approach to test, in a scenario-sensitivity analysis, whether threatened Alberta boreal caribou (Rangifer tarandus caribou) differentially respond to industrial features (linear features, forest cutblocks, wellsites) and their attributes: presence, density, harvest age, and wellsite activity status. The spatially explicit ABM encapsulates predation risk, heterogeneous resource distribution, and species-specific energetic requirements, and successfully recreates the general behavioral mechanisms driving habitat selection. To create various industry-driven, predation-risk landscape scenarios for the sensitivity analysis, we allowed caribou agents to differentially perceive and respond to industrial features and their attributes. To identify which industry had the greatest relative influence on caribou habitat use and spatial distribution, simulated caribou movement patterns from each of the scenarios were compared with those of actual caribou from the study area, using a pattern-oriented, multi-response optimization approach. Results revealed caribou have incorporated forestry- and oil and gas features into their landscape of fear that distinctly affect their spatial and energetic responses. The presence of roads, pipelines and seismic lines, and, to a minor extent, high-density cutblocks and active wellsites, all contributed to explaining caribou behavioral responses. Our findings also indicated that both industries produced interaction effects, jointly impacting caribou spatial and energetic patterns, as no one feature could adequately explain anti-predator movement responses. We demonstrate that behavior-based ABMs can be applied to understanding, assessing, and isolating non-consumptive anthropogenic impacts, in support of wildlife management. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Agent-based model | Animal movement | Caribou | Multi-response optimization | Predation risk | Scenario-sensitivity analysis,4,0,,SSII-102,Shell

Turbidity associated with river plumes is known to affect the search ability of visual predators and thus can drive 'top-down' impacts on prey populations in complex ecosystems; however, traditional quantification of predator-prey relationships (i.e. stomach content analysis) often fails with larval fish due to rapid digestion rates. Herein, we use novel molecular genetic methods to quantify larval yellow perch (YP) in predator stomachs in western Lake Erie to test the hypothesis that turbidity drives variation in larval predation. We characterize predator stomach content DNA to first identify YP DNA (single nucleotide polymorphism) and then quantify larval YP predation (microsatellite allele counting) in two river plumes differing in turbidity. Our results showed elevated larval YP predation in the less turbid river plume, consistent with a top-down impact of turbidity on larval survival.

Recent studies have recognized the importance of propagule pressure (number of individuals) and colonization pressure (number of species) for explaining establishment success of nonindigenous species. However, the International Ballast Water Management Convention, when ratified, will require ships to satisfy a numeric discharge standard that focuses only on cumulative propagule pressure of all individuals released. Because of practical constraints, the standard does not differentiate between discharges of single vs. multiple species. The assemblage-based approach, which uses rank-abundance gradients to quantify and manage introduction risk, may compensate for this limitation (e.g., even gradient [relatively consistent propagule pressures among n transported species] or uneven gradient [uneven propagule pressures among n transported species]). Here we explore species abundance distributions of zooplankton during transportation in ballast water to assess variability in the structure of assemblages, with implications for the potential development of an assemblage-based management model. Specifically, we explored species abundance distributions for voyages that lasted < 24 h, those from 24 to 48 h, and those from 48 to 72 h (i.e., three time scales). Species abundance distributions within and across transit time scales were highly variable. As transport time increased, we observed a shift from uneven to even rank-abundance gradients. Owing to variation in assemblage structure, the number of organisms necessary to quantify colonization pressure exhibited similarly strong variation within and across time scales. Our study indicates that assemblage-based approaches to estimate introduction risk are warranted, yet the variation inherent in transported assemblages will induce substantial uncertainty within management models.",,4,0,,undefined,

The ecological effects of invasive species depend on myriad environmental contexts, rendering understanding problematic. Functional responses provide a means to quantify resource use by consumers over short timescales and could therefore provide insight into how the effects of invasive species vary over space and time. Here, we use novel in situ microcosm experiments to track changes in the functional responses of two aquatic mesopredators, one native and the other an invader, as they undergo diel vertical migrations through a lake water column. 2. The Ponto-Caspian mysid, Hemimysis anomala, a known ecologically damaging invader, generally had higher a functional response towards cladoceran prey than did a native trophic analogue, Mysis salemaai. However, this differential was spatiotemporally dependent, being minimal during the day on the lake bottom, and increasing at night, particularly inshore. 3. Because the functional response of the native predator was spatiotemporally consistent, the above pattern was driven by changes in the invader functional response over the diel cycle. In particular, the functional response of H. anomala was significantly reduced on the lake bottom during the daytime relative to night, and predation was especially pronounced in shallow surface waters. 4. We demonstrate the context dependency of the effects of an invasive predator on prey populations and emphasise the utility of functional responses as tools to inform our understanding of predator-prey interactions. In situ manipulations integrate experimental rigour with field relevance and have the potential to reveal how impacts manifest over a range of spatiotemporal scales.",Diurnal vertical migration | Ecological impacts | Functional response | In situ predation | Invasive species,16,0,,undefined,

Two factors considered as null models when assessing the potential for invasion are colonization pressure (i.e., the number of species introduced) and propagule pressure [i.e., the number (propagule size), and frequency (propagule number), of individuals of each species introduced]. We translate the terminology of species abundance distributions to the invasion terminology of propagule size and colonization size (PS and CS, respectively). We conduct hypothesis testing to determine the underlying statistical species abundance distribution for zooplankton assemblages transported between freshwater ecosystems; and, on the basis of a lognormal distribution, construct four hypothetical assemblages spanning assemblage structure, rank-abundance gradient (e.g., even vs uneven), total abundance (of all species combined), and relative contribution of PS vs CS. For a given CS, many combinations of PS and total abundance can occur when transported assemblages conform to a lognormal species abundance distribution; therefore, for a given transportation event, many combinations of CS and PS are possible with potentially different ecological outcomes. An assemblage exhibiting high PS but low CS (species poor, but highly abundant) may overcome demographic barriers to establishment, but with lower certainty of amenable environmental conditions in the recipient region; whereas, the opposite extreme, high CS and low PS (species rich, but low abundance per species) may provide multiple opportunities for one of n arriving species to circumvent environmental barriers, albeit with lower potential to overcome demographic constraints. Species abundance distributions and the corresponding influence of CS and PS are some of many influential factors (e.g., demographic and genetic stochasticity, environmental variability, composition of recipient ecosystems) that will help refine an understanding of establishment risk following the human-mediated movement of species.",Biological invasion | Colonization pressure | Propagule pressure | Rank-abundance | Risk assessment | Species abundance distribution,6,1,,undefined,

Research has demonstrated that the sensitivity of avian species to the embyrotoxic effects of dioxin-like compounds can be predicted by the amino acid identities at two key sites within the ligand-binding domain of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor 1 (AhR1). The domestic chicken (Gallus gallus domesticus) has been established as a highly sensitive species to the toxic effects of dioxin-like compounds. Results from genotyping and in vitro assays predict that the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) is also highly sensitive to dioxin-like compound toxicity. The objective of the present study was to test that prediction in vivo. To do this, we used egg injections in field nesting starlings with 3,3',4,4',5-pentachlorobiphenyl (PCB-126), a dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyl. Eggs were dosed with either the vehicle control or 1 of 5 doses (1.4, 7.1, 15.9, 32.1, and 52.9ng PCB-126/g egg). A dose-dependent increase in embryo mortality occurred, and the median lethal dose (LD50; 95% confidence interval [CI]) was 5.61 (2.33-9.08) ng/g. Hepatic CYP1A4/5 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in hatchlings also increased in a dose-dependent manner, with CYP1A4 being more induced than CYP1A5. No effect of dose on morphological measures was seen, and we did not observe any overt malformations. These results indicate that, other than the chicken, the European starling is the most sensitive species to the effects of PCB-126 on avian embryo mortality reported to date, which supports the prediction of relative sensitivity to dioxin-like compounds based on amino acid sequence of the AhR1.

Lake Erie has the longest history of colonization by both Dreissena polymorpha and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis in North America and is therefore optimal for the study of long-term dynamics of dreissenid species. In addition, the morphometry of Lake Erie basins varies dramatically from the shallow western to the deep eastern basin, making this waterbody a convenient model to investigate patterns of Dreissena distribution, as well as interspecies interactions among dreissenids. We compare our data on the distribution, density and wet biomass of both dreissenid species in Lake Erie collected in 2009 and 2011-2012 with previous data. We found that Dreissena spp. distribution in Lake Erie varied depending on the time since the initial invasion, collection depth, and lake basin. In 2009-2012, zebra mussels were smaller than in 1992 and were consistently smaller than quagga mussels. During 2009-2012, quagga mussels were found at all depths and in all basins, while zebra mussels were common in the western basin only, and in the central and eastern basins were limited to shallow depths, resulting in an almost complete replacement of D. polymorpha with D. rostriformis bugensis. In the shallowest western basin of Lake Erie, zebra mussels represented >. 30% of the combined dreissenid density even after more than 20. years of coexistence, providing strong evidence that, even in lakes as large as Lake Erie (or at least its western basin), D. polymorpha may sustain a significant presence for decades without being displaced by quagga mussels.",Biomass | Density | Dreissena polymorpha | Dreissena rostriformis bugensis | Exotic species | Great Lakes,40,0,MOE,GL00E75301,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

A recent study concluded that the risk-benefit of consuming fish from the North American Laurentian Great Lakes, which sustain important commercial and recreational fisheries, is currently unclear. We report the fatty acid (FA) content in skin-off fillets of fifteen fish species from Lake Erie and assess whether recommended dietary requirements for two EFA (EPA and DHA) can be met by safely consuming Lake Erie fishes, as an example of a risk-benefit analysis. Methods: A total of 146 samples were analyzed for FA and contaminant content. A simulated fish consumption advisory (maximum recommended number of meals per month, up to 32) was calculated for each sample, and used to calculate the maximum amount of EPA+DHA that would be consumed if the consumption advisory was followed. Results: All fifteen species had nutritionally desirable PUFA:SAFA (>0.4) and n-3:n-6 (>1). Large, fatty species had the highest EPA+DHA content, but had the most restrictive consumption advisories due to high PCB concentrations. To minimize contaminant exposure while maximizing EPA+DHA intake, consumers should consider small lake whitefish and lake trout, small panfish species, and/or walleye. However, very few species had an EPA+DHA content sufficient to safely meet the highest dietary guidelines while following advisories. Conclusions: Consumption of certain Lake Erie fish, an important recreational and commercial fishery, within the limits of our simulated fish consumption advisories, can be a good supplemental source of beneficial n-3 long chain PUFA. © 2014.",EPA and DHA | Essential fatty acids | Freshwater fish consumption | Great Lakes | Risk-benefit | Subsistence and recreational fishery,27,0,,810368,Environment Canada

Some members of the cod family vocalize as part of their mating system. These calls are produced by rapidly contracting drumming muscles on their swim bladders. Burbot also possess drumming muscles, like their marine counterparts, which may enable them to vocalize. To assess the potential for burbot to make calls, pre-spawning adult burbot were collected and placed in a large under-ice enclosure in Great Slave Lake, Northwest Territories, Canada, along with a recorder that monitored low frequency sound over their spawning period. The recorded acoustic data revealed that burbot called coincident with the onset of their spawning period and that the call signatures were stereotypical of swim bladder generated vocalizations made by other gadoid fishes. Burbot showed a wide repertoire of calls, from slow knocks to fast buzzing, similar to the closely related haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). Although never-before documented, calling by fish under ice-cover is likely an important part of the mating system of under-ice spawning gadoids because light limitation would reduce the usefulness of visual cues. These under-ice communications may be affected by anthropogenic noise from increasing resource development in northern regions. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Burbot | Fish calls | Gadidae | Lota lota | Reproduction | Spawning Great Slave Lake,10,0,,undefined,Research and Development

In the context of biological invasions, determining if and how the individual-level impacts of invasive predators relates to their impacts in multiple-individual situations will inform understanding of how such impacts might propagate through recipient communities. Here, we use functional responses (the relationship between prey consumption rate and prey density) to compare the impacts of the invasive freshwater mysid crustacean Hemimysis anomala with a native counterpart Mysis salemaai when feeding on basal cladoceran prey (i) as individuals, (ii) in conspecific groups and (iii) in conspecific groups in the presence of a higher fish predator, Gasterosteus aculeatus. In the absence of the higher predator, the invader consumed significantly more basal prey than the native, and consumption was additive for both mysid species - that is, group consumption was predictable from individual-level consumption. Invaders and natives were themselves equally susceptible to predation when feeding with the higher fish predator, but an MPE occurred only between the natives and higher predator, where consumption of basal prey was significantly reduced. In contrast, consumption by the invaders and higher predator remained additive. The presence of a higher predator serves to exacerbate the existing difference in individual-level consumption between invasive and native mysids. We attribute the mechanism responsible for the MPE associated with the native to a trait-mediated indirect interaction, and further suggest that the relative indifference to predator threat on the part of the invader contributes to its success and impacts within invaded communities. © 2013 British Ecological Society.",Emergent multiple predator effects | Functional response | Hemimysis anomala | Invasive species | Trait-mediated interactions,49,0,,undefined,

The golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei is a biofouling mollusc native to Southeast Asia that was introduced to South America near the Río de la Plata estuary, Argentina, though the species has subsequently spread more than 2000 km upstream. We analyzed morphological and genetic variation in 24 introduced populations of L. fortunei across its South American range. Relative gill area and shell morphology differed significantly, even among geographically proximate populations. Differences in relative gill area were especially marked across the species' range and were negatively correlated with total suspended solids. Whereas mean gill cilia length, filament width, and interfilamental ciliary junction distance did not differ significantly among populations, mean gill cilia density was significantly lower in populations from areas with high suspended solids. Conversely, morphological differences were not related to the number of haplotypes, haplotype diversity, or nucleotide diversity, based upon analyses of the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 gene. Our results indicate that introduced populations of golden mussels in South America exhibit pronounced morphological variation in shell and gill metrics that appear to result from developmental plasticity in relation to total suspended sediments, as has been observed in other mussel species. These adaptations may have facilitated spread of this species to a wide range of habitats. © 2014, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,11,0,,undefined,

Published by The Company of Biologists Ltd. The conserved Ca2+-binding protein Frequenin (homolog of the mammalian NCS-1, neural calcium sensor) is involved in pathologies that result from abnormal synapse number and probability of neurotransmitter release per synapse. Both synaptic features are likely to be co-regulated but the intervening mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show here that Drosophila Ric8a (a homolog of mammalian synembryn, which is also known as Ric8a), a receptor-independent activator of G protein complexes, binds to Frq2 but not to the virtually identical homolog Frq1. Based on crystallographic data on Frq2 and site-directed mutagenesis on Frq1, the differential amino acids R94 and T138 account for this specificity. Human NCS-1 and Ric8a reproduce the binding and maintain the structural requirements at these key positions. Drosophila Ric8a and Gas regulate synapse number and neurotransmitter release, and both are functionally linked to Frq2. Frq2 negatively regulates Ric8a to control synapse number. However, the regulation of neurotransmitter release by Ric8a is independent of Frq2 binding. Thus, the antagonistic regulation of these two synaptic properties shares a common pathway, Frq2- Ric8a-Gαs, which diverges downstream. These mechanisms expose the Frq2-Ric8a interacting surface as a potential pharmacological target for NCS-1-related diseases and provide key data towards the corresponding drug design.",Ca -binding proteins 2+ | Drosophila | Synapse | X-ray crystallography,18,1,CIHR,MOP-37774,Canadian Institutes of Health Research

The changes that characterize maturation of early neural stem cells (NSCs) remain poorly understood. Here we use mass spectrometry-based cell surface capture technology to profile the cell surface of early NSCs and demonstrate functional requirements for several enriched molecules. Primitive NSCs arise from embryonic stem cells upon removal of Transforming growth factor-b signaling, while definitive NSCs arise from primitive NSCs upon Lif removal and FGF addition. In vivo aggregation assays revealed that N-cadherin upregulation is sufficient for the initial exclusion of definitive NSCs from pluripotent ectoderm, while c-kit signaling limits progeny of primitive NSCs. Furthermore, we implicate EphA4 in primitive NSC survival signaling and Erbb2 as being required for NSC proliferation. This work elucidates several key mediators of NSC function whose relevance is confirmed on forebrain-derived populations and identifies a host of other candidates that may regulate NSCs.© AlphaMed Press 2013.",Developmental gene expression regulation | Embryonic development | Membrane glycoproteins | Neural stem cells,16,0,,undefined,

Here, our goals were to 1) determine the extent of PFAA contamination in sport fish species collected downstream of the airport, 2) explore if the airport could be a potential source, and 3) compare fish PFOS concentrations to consumption advisory benchmarks. The PFOS levels in several sport fish collected from the three locations closest to the airport (<. 40. km) were among the highest previously published in the peer-reviewed literature and also tended to exceed consumption benchmarks. The only other fish that had comparable concentrations were collected in a region affected by inputs from a major fluorinated chemical production facility. In contrast, PFOS concentrations in the two most downstream locations (>. 70. km) were comparable to or below the average concentrations in fish as observed in the literature and were generally below the benchmarks. With regards to perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs), there was no significant decrease in concentrations in fish with distance from the airport and levels were comparable to or below the average concentrations observed in the literature, suggesting that the airport is not a significant source of PFCAs in these fish species. PFOS-based aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) was used at a firefighting training facility at the airport in the 1980s to mid-1990s. Taken together, our results provide evidence that the historical use of AFFF at the airport has resulted in fish PFOS concentrations that exceed the 95th percentile concentration of values reported in the literature to date. © 2014.",Aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) | Fish consumption advisories | Human fish consumers | Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) | Sport fish,28,0,,undefined,Health Canada

Plant and animal communities may exhibit zones of change along a stressor gradient that are disproportionate relative to the incremental change in the stressor. The ability to predict such transitions is essential for effective management intervention because they may indicate irreversible changes in ecological processes. Despite the importance of recognizing transition zones along a stressor gradient, few, if any, investigators have examined these responses across multiple taxa, and no community threshold studies have been reported at large geographic scales. We surveyed benthic macroinvertebrate, fish, bird, diatom, and plant communities in coastal wetlands across a geospatially referenced gradient of anthropogenic stress in the Laurentian Great Lakes. We used Threshold Indicator Taxon Analysis (Baker and King 2010) to analyze each community's response to identify potential zones of disproportionate change in community structure along gradients of major watershed-scale stress: agriculture and urban/suburban development. Our results show surprising congruence in community thresholds among different taxonomic groups, particularly with respect to % developed land in the watershed. We also analyzed uncertainty associated with the community-specific thresholds to understand the ability of different assemblages to predict stress. The high and congruent sensitivity of assemblages to development demonstrates that watershed-scale stress has discernible effects on all biological communities, with increasing potential for ecosystem-scale functional changes. These findings have important implications for identifying reference-condition boundaries and for informing management and policy decisions, in particular, for selecting freshwater protected areas. © 2014 by The Society for Freshwater Science.",land use,21,0,,undefined,

In addition, in the absence of BAG6 or when using a mutant of BAG6 exclusively located in the cytoplasm, autophagy is inhibited, ATG7 is hyperacetylated, TRP53 acetylation is abrogated, and EP300 accumulates in the cytoplasm indicating that BAG6 is involved in the regulation of the nuclear localization of EP300. We also reported that the interaction between BAG6 and EP300 occurs in the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. Moreover, during starvation, EP300 is transported to the nucleus in a BAG6-dependent manner. We concluded that BAG6 regulates autophagy by controlling the localization of EP300 and its accessibility to nuclear (TRP53) and cytoplasmic (ATGs) substrates. © 2014 Landes Bioscience.",Acetylation | ATG | Autophagy | BAT3 | Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling | p53,11,1,ARC,Luxembourg,Ligue Contre le Cancer

If the populations being considered are of management or conservation concern, then identifying the traits under selection (or 'markers') might provide insights into possible intervention strategies during epidemics. We assessed potential for selection on multiple immune and life history traits of Arctic breeding common eiders (Somateria mollissima) during annual avian cholera outbreaks (summers of 2006, 2007 & 2008). We measured prelaying body condition, immune traits, and subsequent reproductive investment (i.e., clutch size) and survival of female common eiders and whether they were infected with Pasteurella multocida, the causative agent of avian cholera. We found no clear and consistent evidence of directional selection on immune traits; however, infected birds had higher levels of haptoglobin than uninfected birds. Also, females that laid larger clutches had slightly lower immune responses during the prelaying period reflecting possible downregulation of the immune system to support higher costs of reproduction. This supports a recent study indicating that birds investing in larger clutches were more likely to die from avian cholera and points to a possible management option to maximize female survival during outbreaks. © 2014 The Authors.

We argue that many ecologically damaging invaders are characterised by their more efficient use of resources. Consequently, comparison of the classical 'functional response' (relationship between resource use and availability) between invasive and trophically analogous native species may allow prediction of invader ecological impact. We review the utility of species trait comparisons and the history and context of the use of functional responses in invasion ecology, then present our framework for the use of comparative functional responses. We show that functional response analyses, by describing the resource use of species over a range of resource availabilities, avoids many pitfalls of 'snapshot' assessments of resource use. Our framework demonstrates how comparisons of invader and native functional responses, within and between Type II and III functional responses, allow testing of the likely population-level outcomes of invasions for affected species. Furthermore, we describe how recent studies support the predictive capacity of this method; for example, the invasive 'bloody red shrimp' Hemimysis anomala shows higher Type II functional responses than native mysids and this corroborates, and could have predicted, actual invader impacts in the field. The comparative functional response method can also be used to examine differences in the impact of two or more invaders, two or more populations of the same invader, and the abiotic (e.g. temperature) and biotic (e.g. parasitism) context-dependencies of invader impacts. Our framework may also address the previous lack of rigour in testing major hypotheses in invasion ecology, such as the 'enemy release' and 'biotic resistance' hypotheses, as our approach explicitly considers demographic consequences for impacted resources, such as native and invasive prey species. We also identify potential challenges in the application of comparative functional responses in invasion ecology. These include incorporation of numerical responses, multiple predator effects and trait-mediated indirect interactions, replacement versus non-replacement study designs and the inclusion of functional responses in risk assessment frameworks. In future, the generation of sufficient case studies for a meta-analysis could test the overall hypothesis that comparative functional responses can indeed predict invasive species impacts. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Biological control | Biotic resistance | Context-dependency | Enemy release | Global change | Impact prediction | Invasion hypotheses | Invasive species | Parasitism | Population stability and viability | Predator-prey | Resource use | Risk assessment | Species-trait comparisons | Type II and III functional responses,110,1,NSERC,85417,National Research Foundation

Globally, Invasive Alien Species (IAS) are considered to be one of the major threats to native biodiversity, with the World Conservation Union (IUCN) citing their impacts as ‘immense, insidious, and usually irreversible’. It is estimated that 11% of the c. 12,000 alien species in Europe are invasive, causing environmental, economic and social damage; and it is reasonable to expect that the rate of biological invasions into Europe will increase in the coming years. In order to assess the current position regarding IAS in Europe and to determine the issues that were deemed to be most important or critical regarding these damaging species, the international Freshwater Invasives - Networking for Strategy (FINS) conference was convened in Ireland in April 2013. Delegates from throughout Europe and invited speakers from around the world were brought together for the conference. These comprised academics, applied scientists, policy makers, politicians, practitioners and representative stakeholder groups. A horizon scanning and issue prioritization approach was used by in excess of 100 expert delegates in a workshop setting to elucidate the Top 20 IAS issues in Europe. These issues do not focus solely on freshwater habitats and taxa but relate also to marine and terrestrial situations. The Top 20 issues that resulted represent a tool for IAS management and should also be used to support policy makers as they prepare European IAS legislation.",Biosecurity | Early warning | Economic analysis | EU legislation | Horizon scanning | Knowledge exchange | Networking | Rapid response | Risk assessment,56,1,,undefined,

In Arabidopsis, the transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) functions as a master regulator of a gene network that is important for floral meristem and organ specification. UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO) is a co-activator of LEAFY and is required for proper activation of APETALA3 in the floral meristem during the specification of stamens and petals. The ufo mutants display defects in other parts of the flower and the inflorescence, suggestive of additional roles. Here we show that the normal determinacy of the developing Arabidopsis leaves is affected by the expression of a gain-of-function UFO fusion protein with the VP16 transcriptional activator domain. In these lines, the rosette and cauline leaf primordia exhibit reiterated serration, and upon flowering produce ectopic meristems that develop into flowers, bract leaves and inflorescences. These striking phenotypes reveal that developing leaves maintain the competency to initiate flower and inflorescence programs. Furthermore, the gain-of-function phenotypes are dependent on LFY and the SEPALLATA (SEP) MADS-box transcription factors, indicative of their functional interactions with UFO. The findings of this study also suggest that UFO promotes the establishment of the lateral meristems and primordia in the peripheral zone of the apical and floral meristems by enhancing the activity of LFY. These novel phenotypes along with the mutant phenotypes of UFO orthologs in other plant species suggest a broader function for UFO in plants. © 2013 Risseeuw et al.",,9,1,,undefined,

The current study investigates reproductive flexibility in acoustic responsiveness through differential attraction between reproductive morphs of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) to conspecific calls. Parental male (PM) round gobies emit calls and females respond to these calls with high specificity. We used playback experiments to determine the response of gobies to recordings of two conspecific calls, a grunt and a drum. For the grunt, reproductive females (RF) displayed a significantly higher response for first approach than nonreproductive males (NRM), but RFs never responded to the drum call. Upon examining withinmorph responses for time spent at a playing speaker, RFs were found to spend the longest time at the grunt call compared to other sound types. In contrast to the female responses, NRMs and sneaker males (SM) displayed a strong preference to the drum call. Overall these results support that the grunt could be for mate attraction while NRMs and SMs may be eavesdropping on the drum call. By determining the relationship between reproductive state and responses to conspecific calls, we show that reproductive state is a critical factor in understanding behavioural responses in fish. © 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",Auditory signalling | communication | conspecific sounds | mate attraction | Neogobius melanostomus | round goby | sound localisation | state-dependent attraction,7,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

XY and XX farmed males did not differ in fertilization and reproductive success. Farmed and wild males exhibited no difference in fertilization success; however, farmed males experienced significantly lower reproductive success relative to wild owing to differences in egg-to-fry survival because of competition with wild-sired offspring. Therefore, farmed males pose ecological risk to wild populations by removing reproductive opportunities from wild males, potentially reducing wild salmon productivity.

Despite the economic and ecological importance of walleye (Sander vitreus) in Lake Erie, no preferred-habitat model exists and the spatial extent of suitable habitat is poorly understood. Empirical species-habitat models for three groups of walleye (juveniles, adults, and all walleye) was developed using records from a long term gill net data base (21. years). We examined the degree to which habitat suitability varies with vertical stratum for each group and whether the new model yields different estimates of available walleye habitat when compared to the current depth-based approach. Walleye occurrence in gill nets was positively related to water temperature, negatively related to water depth and water clarity, and unrelated to dissolved oxygen concentration. A model that incorporated interaction terms among the independent variables performed better than the linear, quadratic, and cubic generalized linear models (GLMs) for all three groups. Our results indicate that the extent of suitable habitat varies spatially in Lake Erie and is greatest in the West basin. Weighted Habitat Suitability Areas (WHSA), a combination of habitat quality and quantity, differed significantly among basins and vertical strata in Lake Erie. The current quota allocation strategy for Lake Erie walleye is based on the proportional amount of preferred habitat by jurisdiction. However, the current depth-based definition of preferred habitat may not be an adequate representation of walleye suitable habitat shared by each jurisdiction. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Habitat suitability model | Lake Erie | Logistic regression model | Sander vitreus | Walleye,12,0,,undefined,Conchologists of America

We investigated whether territory quality and offspring provisioning increase oxidative stress in male snow buntings (Plectrophenax nivalis) using a repeated sampling design. We show that arrival oxidative stress is not a constraint on territory quality or the number of offspring fledged. Nevertheless, owners of higher-quality territories experienced an oxidative cost, with this cost increasing more rapidly in younger males. Males that provisioned offspring at a high rate also experienced increased oxidative stress.

Typically, song is an acoustically complex signal; however, the fee-bee song of the black-capped chickadee is relatively simple. Despite this relative simplicity, two previous studies (Christie et al., 2004b; Hoeschele et al., 2010) found acoustic features within the fee-bee song that contain information regarding an individual's dominance rank; however each of these studies reported a different dominance-related acoustic cue. Specifically, the relative amplitude of the two notes differed between the songs of dominant and subordinate males from northern British Columbia, while the interval pitch ratio differed between the songs of dominant and subordinate males from eastern Ontario. In the current study, we examined six acoustic features within songs from both of the chickadee populations (northern British Columbia and eastern Ontario) examined in these previ- ous studies and used bioacoustic analyses and discriminant function analyses to determine whether there is a consistent dominance-related acoustic cue across both, or in each of these populations. Consistent with the previous findings, the current results indicate that relative amplitude differs based on dominance status in the songs from British Columbia; however, our results failed to reach significance with songs from Ontario. These results suggest that acoustic cues that signal a male's dominance in this species vary with geographic location. Furthermore, examining songs from these two locations and one additional location in northern British Columbia, we found that discriminant function analyses could correctly classify songs based on geographic location. Considering the broad extent of the species' range, black-capped chickadee song is considered relatively invariant; however, our results suggest that there is geographic variation in songs, although the differences are subtle compared to geographic song variation in other species. © 2013 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden.",black-capped chickadees | dominance | fee-bee song | geographic variation | song structure,8,0,,undefined,Canada Foundation for Innovation

The invasive ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi entered the Black Sea in the early 1980s. The invasion was followed by the Azov, Caspian, Baltic and North Seas, and, most recently, the Mediterranean Sea. Previous studies identified two distinct invasion pathways of M. leidyi from its native range in the western Atlantic Ocean to Eurasia. However, the source of newly established populations in the Mediterranean Sea remains unclear. Here we build upon our previous study and investigate sequence variation in both mitochondrial (Cytochrome c Oxidase subunit I) and nuclear (Internal Transcribed Spacer) markers in M. leidyi , encompassing five native and 11 introduced populations, including four from the Mediterranean Sea. Extant genetic diversity in Mediterranean populations (n =8, Na = 10) preclude the occurrence of a severe genetic bottleneck or founder effects in the initial colonizing population. Our mitochondrial and nuclear marker surveys revealed two possible pathways of introduction into Mediterranean Sea. In total, 17 haplotypes and 18 alleles were recovered from all surveyed populations. Haplotype and allelic diversity of Mediterranean populations were comparable to populations from which they were likely drawn. The distribution of genetic diversity and pattern of genetic differentiation suggest initial colonization of the Mediterranean from the Black-Azov Seas (pairwise FST = 0.001-0.028). However, some haplotypes and alleles from the Mediterranean Sea were not detected from the well-sampled Black Sea, although they were found in Gulf of Mexico populations that were also genetically similar to those in the Mediterranean Sea (pairwise FST = 0.010-0.032), raising the possibility of multiple invasion sources. Multiple introductions from a combination of Black Sea and native region sources could be facilitated by intense local and transcontinental shipping activity, respectively. © 2013 Ghabooli et al.",,22,1,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Female brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) were used to assess variation in reproductive traits across eight populations differing in sediment sum PCB concentrations in the Lower Great Lakes region. Differences in maternal carotenoid allocation patterns among these populations were also examined. No significant associations were found between sediment sum PCB concentrations corrected for organic content (OC) and reproductive traits. However, egg diameter was negatively correlated with sediment PCB concentrations not corrected for OC, suggesting that observed relationships between sediment sum PCB concentrations and reproductive traits are driven by classes of environmental contaminants whose bioavailability are not predicted by OC, such as metals. An unexpected positive relationship was also found between egg carotenoid concentrations and sediment PCB concentrations. This positive relationship was explained by the maternal allocation of carotenoids based on a negative correlation between female muscle and egg carotenoid concentrations, where females from less contaminated locations had lower egg and greater muscle carotenoid concentrations than those from more contaminated locations. The results of this study identify sublethal effects of environmental contaminants on reproductive life-history traits in female brown bullhead, and investigations of adaptive mechanisms underlying this variation are warranted. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2013.",,2,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

The use of transcriptomics to quantify population differences in genetically controlled functional gene expression traits holds promise for investigating this divergence associated with possible local adaptation. We use custom microarrays to characterize population divergence in transcription at functionally relevant (metabolic and immune function) genes among tributary populations of rainbow trout from Babine Lake, BC and compare it to neutral divergence estimated from microsatellite markers. Transcriptional divergence (PST) was determined at resting state and in response to metabolic and immune challenges, two major sources of mortality and thus selective forces on juvenile salmonids. Results indicate that the majority of selected genes [56 genes (65%), 64 genes (63%) and 38 genes (78%) under control, temperature and immune challenges respectively] show transcriptional divergence (PST > FST) that is consistent with the action of divergent selection. Patterns of pairwise PST among populations are inconsistent with evolution by drift. In general, it appears that the magnitude and pattern of population divergence in transcription reflect the action of natural selection and identify selection on transcription as a mechanism for local adaptation. These results reinforce the need to conserve salmonids on a tributary basis and provide insight into genetic mechanisms that facilitate local adaptation. © 2013 European Society For Evolutionary Biology.",Gene expression | Genetic structuring | Local adaptation | Microarray,2,0,,undefined,

The darker portions of the flight feather were enriched with Zn and Fe, which supports the suggestion that feather melanins are efficient ligands of some metals found in the environment, sequestering potentially harmful particles away from the body. However, trace lead (Pb) acquired from the regional pollution was detected only in females, and it was distributed across both the melanized and non-melanized portions of the feather suggesting that only some metals are efficiently sequestered by melanins.

As {increment}15N values have been experimentally shown to vary amongst consumers, tissues and diet composition, resolving appropriate species-specific {increment}15N values can be complex. Given the logistical and ethical challenges of controlled feeding experiments for determining {increment}15N values for large and/or endangered species, our objective was to conduct an assessment of a range of reported {increment}15N values that can hypothetically serve as surrogates for describing the predator-prey relationships of four shark species that feed on prey from different trophic levels (i.e., different mean δ15N dietary values). Overall, the most suitable species-specific {increment}15N values decreased with increasing dietary-δ15N values based on stable isotope Bayesian ellipse overlap estimates of shark and the principal prey functional groups contributing to the diet determined from stomach content analyses. Thus, a single {increment}15N value was not supported for this speciose group of marine predatory fishes. For example, the {increment}15N value of 3.7‰ provided the highest percent overlap between prey and predator isotope ellipses for the bonnethead shark (mean diet δ15N = 9‰) whereas a {increment}15N value < 2.3‰ provided the highest percent overlap between prey and predator isotope ellipses for the white shark (mean diet δ15N = 15‰). These data corroborate the previously reported inverse {increment}15N-dietary δ15N relationship when both isotope ellipses of principal prey functional groups and the broader identified diet of each species were considered supporting the adoption of different {increment}15N values that reflect the predators' δ15N-dietary value. These findings are critical for refining the application of stable isotope modeling approaches as inferences regarding a species' ecological role in their community will be influenced with consequences for conservation and management actions. © 2013 Olin et al.",,23,1,,undefined,

Despite this growing interest, a unified cross-platform framework for analysing and visualizing spectral data has not been available. We introduce pavo, an R package that facilitates the organization, visualization and analysis of spectral data in a cohesive framework. pavo is highly flexible, allowing users to (a) organize and manipulate data from a variety of sources, (b) visualize data using R's state-of-the-art graphics capabilities and (c) analyse data using spectral curve shape properties and visual system modelling for a broad range of taxa. In this paper, we present a summary of the functions implemented in pavo and how they integrate in a workflow to explore and analyse spectral data. We also present an exact solution for the calculation of colour volume overlap in colourspace, thus expanding previously published methodologies. As an example of pavo's capabilities, we compare the colour patterns of three African glossy starling species, two of which have diverged very recently. We demonstrate how both colour vision models and direct spectral measurement analysis can be used to describe colour attributes and differences between these species. Different approaches to visual models and several plotting capabilities exemplify the package's versatility and streamlined workflow. pavo provides a cohesive environment for handling spectral data and addressing complex sensory ecology questions, while integrating with R's modular core for a broader and comprehensive analytical framework, automated management of spectral data and reproducible workflows for colour analysis. © 2013 British Ecological Society.",Animal communication | Colour | Colourspace | Receptor noise | Reflectance | Sensory ecology | Spectrometry | Visual model,281,0,NSF,DEB-1210630,National Science Foundation

The recovered water is recycled for bitumen extraction, while the resulting tailings are incorporated into various landforms for reclamation, with one option being conversion of tailings basins to viable end pit lakes. Tailings ponds commonly host diverse microbial communities, including SO4-reducing prokaryotes. The highly reducing nature of the hydrogen sulfide produced by these prokaryotes may impact the biogeochemical cycling of key nutrients. However, the behavioral dynamics of hydrogen sulfide production in ponds containing fluid fine tailings remain to be clearly explained. In this study, microcosms are used as analogues of the sediment-water interface of a tailings pond undergoing reclamation to determine sulfide generation patterns and the behavior of O2. In the microcosms, hydrogen sulfide fluxes correlated positively with biotic activity, reaching levels of over 2×103nmolcm-2s-1, leading to Fe sulfide formation. Depth-related hydrogen sulfide profiles in the microcosms were comparable to those encountered in situ, in Syncrude's West In-Pit, an active tailing pond. Oxygen diffusion across the fluid fine tailing sediment-water interface was controlled to different degrees by both biotic and abiotic processes. The results have implications for quantitatively estimating the impact of hydrogen sulfide production, O2 availability, and biogeochemical cycling of key nutrients important for the success of life in fluid fine tailings-affected ecosystems.

We used a quantitative genetic breeding design to measure the critical swimming speed (U-crit) of offspring (15 and 18 weeks post-hatch) from 36 families of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha), a species with a nonresource-based mating system. We investigated the roles of dam, sire, and dam × sire on offspring U-crit, and estimated contributions of additive and nonadditive genetic effects and maternal effects to phenotypic variation in U-crit at both ages. We also used existing 'high-survival' and 'low-survival' lines of Chinook to determine if these two lines show differences in U-crit. At 15 weeks, there were no significant genetic effects, but at 18 weeks there were significant sire effects. Furthermore, additive genetic effects increased from 26 to 100 % from 15 to 18 weeks post-hatch. The two survival lines also showed differences in U-crit at 18 weeks post-hatch, with higher U-crit associated with ""high-survival"" sires. Collectively, the present study provides evidence for increasing importance of paternal identity (additive genetic variation) on swimming as juvenile offspring age. Given that mortality is high in young Pacific salmon and swimming ability is crucial, the sire effects could potentially shape survival though subsequent developmental stages. The change in the magnitude of effects in the present study indicates that future research should investigate genetic effects across multiple stages for better understanding of how phenotypic traits could respond to selection. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media New York.",Additive genetic effects | Chinook salmon | Maternal and paternal effects | Nonadditive genetic effects | Offspring performance | U-crit,4,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

We collected six standard morphological measurements (tarsus length, tail length, wing chord length, culmen length, beak width, and beak depth) from live birds and museum specimens. We collected data from all recognized subspecies of the three Mesoamerican Melozone species. Morphological measurements capably distinguished males from females in all three species. In all cases, three or fewer morphological measurements were required to identify sex with accuracy levels that ranged from 75-100%, well beyond the 50% expected by chance. Comparisons involving all six measurements yielded accuracies that ranged from 58-93%.

The aim of this study is to test hypotheses, which govern the initiation of sperm motility and swimming performance, through physiological functions of osmolality and Ca2+ ion, in a threatened species of freshwater fish, the redside dace, Clinostomus elongatus. Spermatozoa motility was activated in either ionic or non-ionic media spanning a range of osmolalities. The role of Ca2+ channels on induction of spermatozoa motility and velocity was experimentally investigated by diluting sperm in media that contain various Ca2+ channel blockers. Results show that initiation of spermatozoa motility is a hypo-osmolality dependent mechanism. Inhibitors for L-type Ca2+ channels partially prohibited initiation of spermatozoa motility, while velocity was significantly reduced in both L-type and T-type Ca2+ channel blockers. Examination using W-7, an inhibitor for Ca2+-dependent calmodulin, showed significant decreases in spermatozoa motility and velocity. Involvement for Ca2+ in axonemal beating was confirmed by significant increases in velocity after adding Ca2+ into the activation media, while motility remained unchanged in Ca2+ supplemented activation media. Together, these findings suggest the involvement of Ca2+ in hypo-osmolality-dependent initiation of spermatozoa motility mediated by activation of Ca2+ binding protein in the axoneme of a freshwater fish sperm. Blocking Ca2+ exchange through L- or T-type Ca2+ channel influences flagellar beating force and leads to decrease in spermatozoa velocity. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.",Ca  channel blocker 2+ | Cyprinid | Ion | Osmolality | Reproduction | Sperm,14,0,,P503/12/1834,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

In this study, we investigate possible mechanisms of speciation in zooplankton using the freshwater diaptomids of the ancient lakes of Sulawesi, Indonesia, as a model system. We integrate phylogenetic and population genetic analyses of mitochondrial and nuclear genes with morphological and genome size data. Overall, our results support the conclusion that colonization order and local adaptation are dominant at the large, island scale, whereas at local and intralacustrine scales, speciation processes are regulated by gene flow among genetically differentiated and locally adapted populations. In the Malili lakes, the diaptomid populations are homogenous at nuclear loci, but show two highly divergent mitochondrial clades that are geographically restricted to single lakes despite the interconnectivity of the lake systems. Our study, based on coalescent simulations and population genetic analyses, indicates that unidirectional hybridization allows gene flow across the nuclear genome, but prevents the introgression of mitochondria into downstream populations.

Previous studies with OAC-Rex, a CBB-resistant, white bean variety of Mesoamerican origin, identified two resistance loci associated with the molecular markers Pv-CTT001 and SU91, on chromosome 4 and 8, respectively. Resistance to CBB is assumed to be derived from an interspecific cross with Phaseolus acutifolius in the pedigree of OAC-Rex. Our current whole genome sequencing effort with OAC-Rex provided the opportunity to compare its genome in the regions associated with CBB resistance with the v1.0 release of the P. vulgaris line G19833, which is a large seeded bean of Andean origin, and (assumed to be) CBB susceptible. In addition, the genomic regions containing SAP6, a marker associated with P. vulgaris-derived CBB-resistance on chromosome 10, were compared. These analyses indicated that gene content was highly conserved between G19833 and OAC-Rex across the regions examined (>80%). However, fifty-nine genes unique to OAC Rex were identified, with resistance gene homologues making up the largest category (10 genes identified). Two unique genes in OAC-Rex located within the SU91 resistance QTL have homology to P. acutifolius ESTs and may be potential sources of CBB resistance. As the genomic sequence assembly of OAC-Rex is completed, we expect that further comparisons between it and the G19833 genome will lead to a greater understanding of CBB resistance in bean. © 2013 Perry, DiNatale, Xie, Navabi, Reinprecht, Crosby, Yu, Shi and Pauls.",Common bacterial blight | Comparative genomics | Disease resistance | Next generation sequencing | Phaseolus vulgaris,9,1,,undefined,

This argument rests on the premise that native and alien species in general do not differ in their impacts. Although there are numerous cases that suggest alien predators and herbivores can sometimes cause severe declines or even local extinctions of native species, very few studies have compared the impacts of native and alien consumers on native populations. Location: World-wide. Methods: We have conducted a meta-analysis on a global dataset to compare the effects of native and alien predators and herbivores on native populations occupying a broad range of terrestrial and aquatic environments. Results: The distribution of positive, negative and neutral effects on native prey abundance differed significantly by consumer origin, with alien consumers associated with more negative and fewer positive effects than expected, opposite the finding for native consumers. The effect size of alien consumers was 2.4 times greater than that of native consumers and did not differ between predators and herbivores. The impact of alien consumers did not differ significantly in aquatic (lakes, rivers, oceans) versus terrestrial (continental, island) habitats. Similarly, there was no significant interaction between consumer origin and location, as consumers had similar effects in insular (freshwater, island) and open (continental, marine) systems - contrary to the notion that alien species impacts are mainly problematic for island biota. Main conclusions: We hypothesize that the ecological naïveté of native biota facilitates their enhanced suppression by alien predators and herbivores relative to native enemies.

Appropriate diagnosis of the specific subtypes of this disease is critical for ensuring the best possible patient response to therapy. Currently, therapeutic direction is determined based on the expression of characteristic receptors; while cost effective, this method is not robust and is limited to predicting a small number of subtypes reliably. Using the original 5 subtypes of breast cancer we hypothesized that machine learning techniques would offer many benefits for feature selection. Unlike existing gene selection approaches, we propose a tree-based approach that conducts gene selection and builds the classifier simultaneously. We conducted computational experiments to select the minimal number of genes that would reliably predict a given subtype. Our results support that this modified approach to gene selection yields a small subset of genes that can predict subtypes with greater than 95% overall accuracy. In addition to providing a valuable list of targets for diagnostic purposes, the gene ontologies of selected genes suggest that these methods have isolated a number of potential genes involved in breast cancer biology, etiology and potentially novel therapeutics. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",breast tumor subtype | classification | gene selection,6,0,,undefined,

However, human alterations to freshwater flow have resulted in modifications to the seasonal complexities of estuarine communities. To quantify changes in energy transfer at the trophic guild and consumer levels that result from anthropogenic-altered flow, we evaluated seasonal trends over a 1 yr period in stable isotopes of carbon (δ13C), nitrogen (δ15N) and sulfur (δ34S) in nekton species sampled from 2 subtropical tidal rivers, one that is relatively natural and one that experiences regulated flow discharges that result in autumnal high-flow events. Primary and secondary consumers in the flow-altered estuary exhibited a significant depletion in 13C and enrichment in 15N (~2‰ in both isotopes respectively) with the onset of the wet season, while the stable isotope values of high trophic level species (i.e. ≥ tertiary consumers) remained relatively consistent, trends were not apparent in the natural estuary. These isotopic trends were evident in both benthic and pelagic consumers, suggesting a food web-wide influence of altered flow on nutrient dynamics. Although the relative trophic structure, based on δ15N, was consistent across seasons and among estuaries, the δ34S values were less seasonally variable in the flow-altered estuary and were indicative of more terrestrial/freshwater-influenced values compared to the natural estuary, suggesting a lengthened influence of high flow. Although limited in temporal scope, our results indicate a noteworthy difference in seasonal isotope dynamics of lower trophic level consumers in a flow-altered estuarine food web. The importance of this effect on ecosystem function warrants further attention. © Inter-Research 2013.",Benthic | Disturbance | Pelagic | Resource use | Stable isotopes | Trophic guilds,12,0,,undefined,

In the sea lamprey, there is tight coupling between olfaction and locomotion via PNs extending to the posterior tuberculum from the medial region of the olfactory bulb. This medial region receives peripheral input predominantly from the accessory olfactory organ. However, the axons from olfactory sensory neurons residing in the main olfactory epithelium extend to non-medial regions of the olfactory bulb, and the non-medial bulbar PNs extend their axons to the lateral pallium. It is not known if the receptive fields of the PNs in the two output pathways overlap; nor has the morphology of these PNs been investigated. In this study, retrograde labelling was utilized to investigate the PNs belonging to medial and non-medial projections. The dendrites and somata of the medial PNs were confined to medial glomerular neuropil, and dendrites of non-medial PNs did not enter this territory. The cell bodies and dendrites of the non-medial PNs were predominantly located below the glomeruli (frequently deeper in the olfactory bulb).

However, their ecosystem function is threatened by direct anthropogenic disturbance and climate change. Oil sands surface mining in the boreal regions of Western Canada denudes tracts of land of organic materials, leaves large areas in need of reclamation, and generates considerable quantities of extraction process-affected materials. Knowledge and validation of reclamation techniques that lead to self-sustaining wetlands has lagged behind development of protocols for reclaiming terrestrial systems. It is important to know whether wetlands reclaimed with oil sands process materials can be restored to levels equivalent to their original ecosystem function. We approached this question by assessing carbon flows and food web structure in naturally formed and oil sands-affected wetlands constructed in 1970-2004 in the postmining landscape. We evaluated whether a prescribed reclamation strategy, involving organic matter amendment, accelerated reclaimed wetland development, leading to wetlands that were more similar to their natural marsh counterparts than wetlands that were not supplemented with organic matter. We measured compartment standing stocks for bacterioplankton, microbial biofilm, macrophytes, detritus, and zoobenthos; concentrations of dissolved organic carbon and residual naphthenic acids; and microbial production, gas fluxes, and aquatic-terrestrial exports (i.e., aquatic insect emergence). The total biomass of several biotic compartments differed significantly between oil sands and reference wetlands. Submerged macrophyte biomass, macroinvertebrate trophic diversity, and predator biomass and richness were lower in oil sands-affected wetlands than in reference wetlands. There was insufficient evidence to conclude that wetland age and wetland amendment with peat-mineral mix mitigate effects of oil sands waste materials on the fully aquatic biota. Although high variability was observed within most compartments, our data show that 20-year-old wetlands containing oil sands material have not yet reached the same level of function as their reference counterparts. © 2013 by the Ecological Society of America.",Carbon flows | Ecosystem function | Macroinvertebrates | Naphthenic acids | Oil sands | Tar sands | Wetland reclamation,13,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

We collected 154 ballast water samples from ships that had performed or were exempt from ballast water exchange (BWE) prior to arrival at Pacific and Atlantic ports in Canada and Laurentian Great Lakes ports. We found that abundance and species richness varied across taxa and regions, with ships arriving to the Atlantic region carrying the highest abundance of taxa. The highest species richness of invertebrates and diatoms was recorded from ships arriving to the Pacific, whereas the richest communities of dinoflagellates occurred in the Atlantic region. We also found that BWE had no effect on abundance or species richness of most taxa (dinoflagellates, diatoms, bacteria, and virus-like particles), whereas the effect on abundance of invertebrates was not clear. Finally, longer voyages resulted in lower abundance of all taxa except dinoflagellates, and lower species richness of diatoms. Paradoxically, the elevated abundance and species richness of dinoflagellates following BWE suggest that this group could have enhanced invasion potential when ships manage ballast water by exchange. © 2013, by the Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,27,0,,undefined,

This yolk provisioning leads to maternal offloading of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to eggs and larvae. Previous research has shown that Chinook salmon larvae exhibit limited capacity to eliminate POPs during the cold water period resulting in bioamplification of POP residues. This study compared POPs bioamplification in Chinook salmon larvae under a high food provisioning treatment and a non-fed treatment to test whether or not food availability attenuates POPs bioamplification via growth dilution. Results demonstrate that larvae in the food provisioning treatment did not gain weight until after day 129. Between hatching and day 129, fed and non-fed treatments exhibited similar decreases in whole body lipid content, negligible POPs elimination and POPs bioamplification factors approaching 1.6. By day 184 of the study, POPs bioamplification factors in the non-fed treatment were as high as 5.3 across chemicals but ranged from non-detectable to approaching 1 in the fed group. This study demonstrates that POPs bioamplification occurs in Chinook salmon larvae even under ideal rearing conditions but peaks after day 129, following which growth dilution can attenuate bioamplification relative to starved individuals. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.",Bioaccumulation | Bioamplification | Biodilution | Persistent organic pollutants | Toxicokinetics,5,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

By observing the behaviour of territorial animals as they respond to playback-simulated duets of rivals, we can gain insight into the behavioural significance of vocal duets. Playback experiments, however, have been conducted across a very narrow range of duetting animals. Furthermore, many studies have been conducted with single-speaker playback, whereas stereo-speaker playback offers more spatially realistic simulation of duets. Moreover, by evaluating the reactions of animals to separate loudspeakers broadcasting male and female duet contributions, we can study the interactions of both males and females with same-sex vs. opposite-sex rivals. We used a paired experimental design to broadcast duet stimuli through a single-speaker and a stereo-speaker apparatus to 30 pairs of duetting barred antshrikes Thamnophilus doliatus in Costa Rica. Our goals were (1) to evaluate whether territorial antbirds respond more aggressively to male vs. female duet components and (2) to assess aggressive responses of antbirds towards single-speaker vs. stereo-speaker playback. Neither males nor females differentiated between the loudspeaker simulating the male vs. female duet contribution during stereo-speaker playback trials. Barred antshrikes displayed significantly stronger responses to stereo-speaker playback compared with single-speaker playback. Males displayed stronger playback responses than females with closer, quicker and more vocal responses. These results provide evidence for a joint resource defence function of antbird duets given that pairs responded together with equivalent intensity to male and female simulated intruders. This is the first study to show that although duetting is an aggressive territorial signal, birds do not necessarily respond to sex-specific components of duets. Our results support the idea that spatially realistic stereo presentation of duet stimuli is critical for experimental duet research. © 2013 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,13,0,,undefined,

However, detection of rare species poses immense technical challenges, especially for morphologically cryptic species, microscopic taxa and those beneath the water surface in aquatic ecosystems. Next-generation sequencing technology provides a robust tool to assess biodiversity, especially for detection of rare species. Here, we assess the sensitivity of 454 pyrosequencing for detection of rare species using known indicator species spiked into existing complex plankton samples. In addition, we develop universal small subunit ribosomal DNA primers for amplification of a wide range of taxa for detailed description of biodiversity in complex communities. A universality test of newly designed primers for the hypervariable V4 region of the nuclear small subunit ribosomal DNA (V4-nSSU) using a plankton sample collected from Hamilton Harbor showed that 454 pyrosequencing based on this universal primer pair can recover a wide range of taxa, including animals, plants (algae), fungi, blue-green algae and protists. A sensitivity test showed that 454 pyrosequencing based on newly designed universal V4-nSSU primers was extremely sensitive for detection of very rare species. Pyrosequencing was able to recover spiked indicator species with biomass percentage as low as approximately 2·3 × 10-5% when 24 artificially assembled samples were tagged and sequenced in one PicoTiter plate (i.e. sequencing depth of an equivalent of 1/24 PicoTiter plate). In addition, spiked rare species were sometimes recovered as singletons (i.e. Operational Taxonomic Units represented by a single sequence), suggesting that at least some singletons are informative for recovering unique lineages in 'rare biospheres'. The method established here allows biologists to better investigate the composition of aquatic communities, especially for detection of rare taxa. Despite a small-scale pyrosequencing effort, we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of pyrosequencing using rare species spiked into plankton samples.

HLCs and structure-property relationships were assessed for 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene (TeCB), pentachlorobenzene (PeCB), and hexachlorobenzene (HCB). HLCs were determined using the volatilization rate (kv) of sparged chemical at 25°C. Despite the assumption that kv should be constant throughout the stripping duration, results indicated that kv decreased over time according to three separate slope regions. Results of ANCOVA indicate that kv is statistically different in the third slope region, which leads to the conclusion that use of the entire stripping data set would lead to biased HLCs. This decrease in kv may be attributed to desorption from sparger surfaces, which has not been considered widely in the literature. Statistical analysis was possible because of the robustness of the current experimental procedure which included numerous replications (15 total spargers) and extensive data points available to discern key slope changes. HLCs determined using the gas stripping technique were 57, 33, and 30Pam3mol-1 for 1,2,4,5-TeCB, PeCB, and HCB, respectively.

This variation may contain important information used by animals for individual recognition. Suboscine birds are thought to develop song by fully innate mechanisms and are poorly studied relative to oscine birds, where song learning results in significant variation in song structure among individuals and the development of dialects. Recent research, however, demonstrates that suboscine song is often individually distinctive and in some cases shows signs of regional variation. We used spectrogram cross-correlation and canonical discriminant function analysis to examine individual and geographic variations in songs of Eastern Phoebes (Sayornis phoebe), suboscine birds with two song types. Both song types were individually distinctive and showed significantly higher cross-correlations within than among individuals. Discriminant function analysis correctly assigned 85.3% of ""phee-bee"" and 90.0% of ""phee-b-be-bee"" songs to the correct male, levels that are significantly higher than expected by chance. The individually distinctive characters of songs were also significantly repeatable among recording sessions. Eastern Phoebe song did not vary geographically between two populations separated by 640 km; permuted discriminant function analysis assigned 65% of ""phee-bee"" and 70% of ""phee-b-be-bee"" songs to the correct population, which did not differ significantly from chance expectations. Variation among males in song characteristics could be used by both males and females to discriminate among individuals. These detailed bioacoustic analyses support the idea that individual distinctive acoustic signals are widespread across suboscine birds.

Recently, achromatic plumage reflectance has been shown to indicate condition, yet the condition-dependence of achromatic patch size remains unstudied. Here we show the first evidence that alula size, an achromatic plumage patch, has the potential to signal a male's condition and predict reproductive performance. In Arctic-breeding snow buntings Plectrophenax nivalis, the size of the alula simultaneously predicted pre-breeding physiological health and the number of offspring produced, through an intermediate variable (lay date). Snow buntings appear to pair assortatively; males and females arriving earlier pair together, and changes in body condition over the breeding season are positively related within pairs. We suggest that simple achromatic plumage patches, like alula size, have the potential to act as condition-dependent signals. Consequently, females may benefit from assessing these signals to reliably evaluate a male's condition and reproductive potential as a means of maximizing their reproductive success. © 2013 The Authors.

Long-term monitoring of adult mayflies at shoreline areas had revealed that Hexagenia rigida was more abundant than Hexagenia limbata during the initial recolonization period, but was gradually replaced by H. limbata. We hypothesized that this shift in dominance would be confirmed by the distribution and abundance of nymphs. We identified nymphs collected each spring throughout western Lake Erie from 1997 to 2004. The relative abundances of H. rigida and H. limbata nymphs exhibited the same temporal sequence as adults. Furthermore, the number of sites in the western basin in which H. rigida occurred decreased as the occurrence frequency of H. limbata increased. H. limbata were dominant in the basin by 2004. Hexagenia limbata nymphs persisted in the center-most part of the basin, whereas H. rigida did not, possibly due to differences in tolerance to hypoxia. There were no significant differences in body size between the two populations. Differences in dispersal distance from source populations and the timing and success of egg hatching likely accounted for the initial colonizing success of H. rigida, but the differential ability of H. limbata eggs to overwinter in sediments and possible tolerance of nymphs to hypoxia has possibly led to its current dominance in the western basin. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Hexagenia | Lake Erie | Recolonization | Species replacement | Succession,2,0,OMAF,undefined,University of Windsor

Dormant stages are typically produced as a strategy to overcome inhospitable environmental conditions and can also facilitate species dispersal. While they often sink and accumulate in sediment of natural habitats forming 'egg banks,' dormant stages are also found in the sediments accumulated in ships' ballast tanks. Recent studies have used 2 different methods to separate dormant stages from ballast sediment to assess invasion risk associated with ballast tanks: the colloidal silica sol Ludox HS 40 and sugar flotation (i.e. the Onbé-Marcus method). It has been assumed that the Ludox HS 40 method is most effective for separation but reduces dormant stage viability whereas sugar flotation has lower separation efficacy but higher resulting viability. We conducted a comparative assessment of the 2 methods by separating dormant stages from 160 ballast sediments and examining resulting abundance counts, hatching results, DNA extractions and PCR amplifications. We found no difference in the results between the methods. The financial cost of sugar flotation is lower than that of Ludox HS 40, and costs can be further reduced by using only 1 method instead of both due to lower labour costs, particularly for a large number of samples. © The authors 2013.",Colloidal silica sol ludox HS 40 | Method comparison | Onbé-Marcus method | Sugar flotation,3,1,,undefined,

We measured plumage reflectance and pigmentation patterns made conspicuous during male inter-and intrasexual displays that advertise different plumage regions. Our results indicate that although several aspects of male plumage may have redundant messages, different body regions appear aimed at different receivers. The wings of males-displayed primarily toward females during courtship-appear to indicate a pair's future reproductive performance. Conversely, melanin-based plumage reflectance displayed during intrasexual threat displays provides information on territory features and a male's capacity to defend it (i.e., territory size, territory quality, testosterone levels). Taken together, we suggest that snow buntings have multiple ornaments that provide information of differential importance in inter-versus intrasexual communication.

Gene transcription is a highly regulated step in the expression of a phenotype and it has been shown to respond to selection and thus may be one mechanism that facilitates the development of local adaptation. Advances in molecular genetic tools and an increased understanding of the functional roles of specific genes allow us to test hypotheses concerning the role of variable environments in shaping transcription at known-function candidate loci. To address these hypotheses, wild rainbow trout were collected in their first summer and subjected to metabolic and immune challenges. We assayed gene transcription at candidate loci that play a role in the molecular genetic response to these stresses, and correlated transcription with temperature data from the streams and the abundance and diversity of bacteria as characterized by massively parallel pyrosequencing. Patterns of transcriptional regulation from resting to induced levels varied among populations for both treatments. Co-inertia analysis demonstrated significant associations between resting levels of metabolic gene transcription and thermal regime (R2 = 0.19, P = 0.013) as well as in response to challenge (R2 = 0.39, P = 0.001) and resting state and challenged levels of cytokine gene transcription with relative abundances of bacteria (resting: R2 = 0.25, P = 0.009, challenged: R2 = 0.65, P = 0.001).

Research on discrimination between the acoustic signals of heterospecific versus conspecific animals, especially in birds, has focused on the songs produced by breeding males, in spite of the fact that animals produce other types of acoustic signals such as calls and duets. We used acoustic playback experiments to evaluate whether tropical white-eared ground-sparrows, Melozone leucotis, use calls, male solo songs and duets to discriminate conspecific from heterospecific competitors. We also evaluated whether prior experience influences competitors' discrimination by comparing responses among populations of white-eared ground-sparrows that are allopatric and sympatric with a congeneric competitor species (Prevost's ground-sparrows, Melozone biarcuatum). White-eared ground-sparrows displayed more intense responses to conspecific vocalizations than they did to congeneric vocalizations. The duets produced in response to conspecific playback exhibited higher bandwidth and maximum frequency, lower minimum frequency and longer duration than duets produced in response to heterospecific playback. These results suggest that white-eared ground-sparrows use information encoded in vocalizations to discriminate competitors from noncompetitor species. The observed responses were not influenced by previous experience; white-eared ground-sparrows displayed similar responses whether they lived in sympatry or allopatry with the congener simulated through playback.

We validated methods for identifying baseline CORT of lethally sampled birds and assessed variation in baseline CORT relative to winter habitat conditions. We collected free-living white-winged scoters (Melanitta fusca) at four wintering sites during December and February. We found increasing CORT values beyond 3 min after time since flush (the duration between initial flush and death), presumably reflecting acute stress responses. Our results demonstrate that it is possible to obtain baseline CORT from lethally sampled birds if the time from initial flush until death is measured. Our study sites varied appreciably in exposure to wind and waves, predation danger, diving depths, and the fraction of preferred foods in scoter diets. Despite these habitat differences, baseline CORT did not vary across sites or winter periods.

Following damage, intestinal stem cells (ISCs) regenerate the intestine by proliferating to replace dying cells. ISCs from diverse animals are remarkably similar, and the Wnt, Notch, and Hippo signaling pathways, important regulators of mammalian ISCs, are conserved from flies to humans. Unexpectedly, we identified the transcription factor period, a component of the circadian clock, to be critical for regeneration, which itself follows a circadian rhythm. We discovered hundreds of transcripts that are regulated by the clock during intestinal regeneration, including components of stress response and regeneration pathways.

At the receptor level, both the fish ear and the neuromast hair cells act as displacement detectors and both are potentially stimulated by the particle motion component of sound sources, especially in the nearfield. A now common way to test ?hearing' in fish involves auditory evoked potentials (AEPs), with recordings made from electrodes implanted near the auditory brainstem. These AEP recordings are typically conducted in enclosed acoustic environments with the fish well within the nearfield, especially for lower frequencies. We tested the contribution of neuromast hair cells to AEP by first testing intact goldfish (Carassius auratus), then ablating their neuromasts with streptomycin sulphate-disabling superficial and canal neuromasts-and retesting the same goldfish. We performed a similar experiment where only the superficial neuromasts were physically ablated. At 100 and 200Hz, there was a 10-15?dB increase in threshold after streptomycin treatment but no significant difference at higher frequencies. There was no difference in threshold in control fish or in fish that only had superficial neuromasts removed, indicating that the differential responses were driven by canal neuromasts. Taken together, these results indicate that AEP results at lower frequencies should be interpreted as multimodal responses, rather than as 'hearing'. The results also suggest that in natural situations both the ear and lateral line likely play an integrative role in detecting and localising many types of 'acoustic' stimuli. © 2013.

In recent studies of frog eye development we discovered that pitx3 expresses symmetrically in the somites and lateral plate mesoderm and asymmetrically during cardiac and gut looping. We report that disruption of pitx3 activity on one side of an embryo relative to the other, either by over-or underexpression of pitx3, elicits a crooked dorsal axis in embryos that is a consequence of a retarded progression through somitogenesis. Unlike in amniotes, Xenopus somites form as cohorts of presomitic cells that rotate perpendicular to the dorsal axis. Since no vertebral anomalies have been reported in mouse and human Pitx3 mutants, we attempt to distinguish whether the segmentation clock is uniquely affected in frog or if the pitx3 perturbation inhibits the cellular changes that are necessary to rotation of presomitic cells.

We performed population genetics and phylogenetic analyses to investigate population genetic structure across native and introduced regions. Introduced populations in Asia exhibit higher genetic diversity (HE = 0.667-0.746) than those in South America (HE = 0.519-0.575), suggesting higher introduction effort for the former populations. We observed pronounced geographical structuring in introduced regions, as indicated by both mitochondrial and nuclear markers based on multiple genetic analyses including pairwise ΦST FST, Bayesian clustering method, and three-dimensional factorial correspondence analyses. Pairwise FST values within both Asia (FST = 0.017-0.126, P = 0.000-0.009) and South America (FST = 0.004-0.107, P = 0.000-0.721) were lower than those between continents (FST = 0.180-0.319, P = 0.000). Fine-scale genetic structuring was also apparent among introduced populations in both Asia and South America, suggesting either multiple introductions of distinct propagules or strong post-introduction selection and demographic stochasticity. Higher genetic diversity in Asia as compared to South America is likely due to more frequent propagule transfers associated with higher shipping activities between source and donor regions within Asia. This study suggests that the intensity of human-mediated introduction vectors influences patterns of genetic diversity in non-indigenous species. © 2013 Ghabooli et al.",,17,1,,undefined,

Partitioning of HOCs 1,2,4,5-tetrachlorobenzene, pentachlorobenzene, and hexachlorobenzene to COC for both 1.5 μm and 1 kDa filtrates of PE was investigated using the gas-stripping technique.

The current study examined how auditory function in the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), a vocal teleost, co-varied with sex, reproductive condition and female plasma 17β-estradiol level. Auditory evoked potentials were collected in response to tone pips (100-600 Hz) and a natural round goby pulse vocalization. Additionally, saccule hair cell densities were compared across reproductive groups. Auditory threshold was evaluated in terms of pressure and particle acceleration, and response amplitude and onset latency were measured at 10dB above threshold. Relative to males, females displayed lower auditory thresholds in response to the natural vocalization and to tones at 300-600 Hz, and had a higher density of saccule hair cells. The 17β-estradiol level was positively associated with amplitude and latency for the pulse stimulus and with both threshold and amplitude for tones at 100-200 Hz in females. Relative to non-reproductive males, reproductive males exhibited longer response latencies at 100-200 Hz. The results demonstrate sexual dimorphism in auditory function in a teleost fish as well as intra-sexual variation, partially based on hormone levels.

This is of particular importance for monitoring sharks at remote locations or in regions where there are no reliable data on shark numbers, fishing effort and current population status. Through establishing a standardized recreational SCUBA diver observation programme, this study examined the number, size and sex-composition of grey reef sharks, Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos, on a remote coral reef system off the Red Sea coast of Sudan. In addition, placard tags were attached to individual sharks to examine coarse scale residency and movement patterns and to determine the effectiveness of this technique. Over a 4.5 month period (December 2007-April 2008), a mean (±SE) of 5.9Â ±Â 0.3 grey reef sharks were observed per diving day with peak numbers of sharks associated with temperatures of 26-26.9°C and strong currents. Estimated mean (±SE) total length of observed sharks was 1.9Â ±Â 0.03Â m identifying that most animals were mature. Female sharks were dominant on the site and pregnant females were recorded. Placard tagged sharks (NÂ =Â 4) were observed by recreational SCUBA divers throughout the study period (23.1%, 20.0%, 16.9% and 3.1% of total observation diving days) indicating sporadic site attachment. The placard tags remained intact and were free of fouling for a total of 175 days. The numbers of grey reef sharks seen on this Red Sea coral complex suggest a healthy, relatively unexploited population. This study demonstrates that the recreational diver community, which forms a large pool of skilled volunteers, can generate baseline data on shark numbers at regularly dived sites and provide insights into the ecology of the observed species. Modification of placard tags, including attachment to the dorsal fin and time corrodible release systems may provide an inexpensive and accepted tool for monitoring individual shark residency and movement patterns. Engaging the recreational SCUBA diver community in a standardized scientific monitoring programme has the potential to monitor trends in shark populations over large spatial and temporal scales.

Prior to attempting such population control techniques, the pheromones must be identified and their possible influences on non-target species addressed. The round goby (Neogobius melanostomus) is a species invasive to the Great Lakes region, and negatively impacts the ecosystem by interfering with local fish populations. At least two 5β-reduced 3α-hydroxyl steroids released by reproductive N. melanostomus (11-O-ETIO and 11-O-ETIO-3s) evoke olfactory sensory responses from the olfactory epithelium of conspecifics, and water conditioned by reproductive males (containing these steroids) attracts female round gobies. In this study, we examined whether these putative pheromones, along with simultaneously-released 11-O-ETIO-17s, stimulate olfactory sensory responses from alternative fish species sharing the same ecosystem as N. melanostomus in the Great Lakes region.

When compared to round goby responses from previous studies, amino acids and the bile acid consistently elicited electro-olfactogram responses across all species, but only round gobies showed a response to the putative pheromones.

Many researchers have interpreted phenotypic responses as unavoidable negative outcomes (e.g., small birth weight, high anxiety); however, a biased underestimate of the adaptive potential of MDS-induced effects is possible if they are not viewed within an ecologically relevant or a life-history optimization framework. We review the ecological and environmental drivers of MDS, how MDS signals are transferred to offspring, and what responses MDS induces. Results from four free-living vertebrate systems reveals that although MDS induces seemingly negative investment trade-offs in offspring, these phenotypic adjustments can be adaptive if they better match the offspring to future environments; however, responses can prove maladaptive if they unreliably predict (i.e., are mismatched to) future environments. Furthermore, MDS-induced adjustments that may prove maladaptive for individual offspring can still prove adaptive to mothers by reducing current reproductive investment, and benefitting lifetime reproductive success. We suggest that to properly determine the adaptive potential of MDS, researchers must take a broader integrated life-history perspective, appreciate both the immediate and longer term environmental context, and examine lifetime offspring and maternal fitness. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.",Environmental mismatch | Glucocorticoids | Maternal effects | Maternal matching | Maternal programming | Maternal stress | Stress hormones,133,0,,undefined,

However, few ecologists are aware of the capacity for maternal GC exposure to translate ecological and environmental stressors into preparative and adaptive programmed offspring responses in free-living systems. We review a growing body of experimental work indicating that circulating maternal GCs link ecological stressors with adaptive programming of the stress axis. Throughout, we emphasise that natural and human-induced ecological stressors play a fundamental role in programming the capacity of individuals, populations and communities to respond to both predictable and unpredictable ecological change via translating maternal adversity into responsive programming of the vertebrate stress axis. To encourage rigorous testing of this paradigm in a broad range of ecological systems, we introduce the principal extrinsic stressors with a recognised potential to alter maternal circulating GC levels. We then review from the biomedical literature regarding the underlying physiological and epigenetic mechanisms of stress-induced programming of individual phenotypes to predict how variation in ecological stressors can produce individual variation in stress axis management. To appreciate the potential evolutionary inertia (i.e. adaptive value) of maternally programmed individual variation, we review key recent studies in free-living systems that test its adaptive function, and then discuss how variation in stress-axis programming may scale up to influence populations and ecological communities. Given the huge potential of this field, it is encouraging that ecologists are beginning to examine how and why maternal GCs translate ecological and environmental stressors into preparative stress axis programming in free-living systems. © 2012 The Authors.

During the growth trials, all O. tshawytscha stocks were reared separately or in either mixed channel and hatchery or transfer and hatchery groups for comparison of performance to traditional practices. After 60days in fresh water, all O. tshawytscha were transferred to seawater for an additional 30days. Reared separately, all stocks grew c. 4·5 fold over 90days but specific growth rate (G) and food conversion efficiency were higher in fresh water than after seawater transfer on day 60. In contrast, hatchery O. tshawytscha from mixed hatchery and channel and hatchery and transfer growth trials had a larger mass and length gain than their counterparts on day 60, but reduced G in seawater. In general, plasma levels of growth hormone, insulin-like growth factor I and cortisol did not differ among any O. tshawytscha groups in either the separate or mixed growth trials. Despite some differences in gill Na+,K+-ATPase activity, all O. tshawytscha had a high degree of seawater tolerance and experienced virtually no perturbation in plasma chloride following seawater transfer.

We examined long-term population estimates and used stable isotopes of carbon (δ 13C) and nitrogen (δ 15N) paired with stomach content analysis to quantify the trophic ecology and niche overlap of adult yellow perch and white perch in the western basin of Lake Erie. We found that changes in yellow perch abundance since 1979 appeared to be better correlated with changes in fishery exploitation rates than with food competition effects from white perch. At the time of this study, yellow perch were found to have higher δ 13C values, indicating greater utilization of benthic food resources than white perch, and white perch occupied higher trophic positions based on δ 15N. The diets of both species varied spatially and seasonally based on stable isotopes and stomach contents, likely driven by changes in prey abundance. Comparison of niche widths using stable isotope population metrics and Schoener diet similarity index suggested a low to moderate degree of niche overlap between species. Isotopic niches of white perch were generally larger than those of yellow perch demonstrating broader resource utilization by this non-indigenous species. We submit that isotopic niche overlap comparisons are more appropriate for studies seeking to understand interactions among populations over course temporal scales, while diet overlap indices, such as the Schoener index provide a means to study fine-scale interactions such as ontogenetic and seasonal diet shifts. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Diet | Food web | Laurentian Great Lakes | Niche width | Population metrics | Stable isotopes | Stomach content analysis | White perch | Yellow perch,29,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

Societies often seek to mitigate threats to these services through largescale, costly restoration projects, such as the over one billion dollar Great Lakes Restoration Initiative currently underway. To help inform these efforts, we merged high-resolution spatial analyses of environmental stressors with mapping of ecosystem services for all five Great Lakes. Cumulative ecosystem stress is highest in nearshore habitats, but also extends offshore in Lakes Erie, Ontario, and Michigan. Variation in cumulative stress is driven largely by spatial concordance among multiple stressors, indicating the importance of considering all stressors when planning restoration activities. In addition, highly stressed areas reflect numerous different combinations of stressors rather than a single suite of problems, suggesting that a detailed understanding of the stressors needing alleviation could improve restoration planning. We also find that many important areas for fisheries and recreation are subject to high stress, indicating that ecosystem degradation could be threatening key services. Current restoration efforts have targeted high-stress sites almost exclusively, but generally without knowledge of the full range of stressors affecting these locations or differences among sites in service provisioning. Our results demonstrate that joint spatial analysis of stressors and ecosystem services can provide a critical foundation for maximizing social and ecological benefits from restoration investments.",Cumulative impact | Fresh water | Laurentian Great Lakes | Marine spatial planning,175,1,,undefined,

Bioavailable water concentrations of PCBs were similar in magnitude and trends to dissolved water concentrations reported in previous studies using direct sampling approaches. PCB concentrations exhibited complex temporal patterns at the six biomonitoring stations with multi-year declines in PCB trajectories between 1996 and 2002 and less consistent trends occurring across stations in later years. Spatial patterns of PCBs during 2002 revealed significantly higher water contamination on the US side of the river (seasonal average mean±standard error (SE) sum PCB concentration of 0.63±0.11ngL-1) compared to the Canadian side (mean±SE sum PCB concentration of 0.09±0.01ngL-1).

Antbirds (Thamnophilidae) are a biodiverse family of more than 200 species found throughout Central and South America, yet their ecology and behaviour are poorly known. In this study, we provide the first detailed description of the vocalizations and vocal behaviour of Barred Antshrikes (Thamnophilus doliatus), a widespread Neotropical suboscine passerine. We studied 38 territorial pairs in a population in Costa Rica from 2008 to 2010, using field recordings and observations to quantify their vocalizations and vocal behaviour. Males and females produced similar songs consisting of rapidly repeated chuckling notes. Several aspects of their songs distinguish the sexes: male songs were longer in duration, contained more syllables, and were lower in pitch. Males had a higher song output than females, but within song bouts males and females sang at similar rates. Barred Antshrike song output varied daily, with the highest song output occurring at dawn. Song output also varied seasonally, with increased song output occurring during the breeding period. Males and females combined songs to create duets, overlapping the terminal portion of their mate's song. Most duets were created by females responding to male songs (84 %), and the rest by males responding to female songs. The timing of duet responsiveness varied between the sexes; males responded more quickly to their partner's song (1. 6 s) than females (2. 0 s). This detailed account of the vocalizations and vocal behaviour of a population of Barred Antshrikes creates a foundation for future comparative studies of antbirds. Our study highlights similarities and differences in the behavioural patterns of tropical birds and contributes to our understanding of the function of vocal duets and the vocal behaviour of antbirds. © 2012 Dt.

Unfortunately, black soldier flies only convert waste during their larval feeding stages and therefore it is of interest to optimize the nonfeeding stages of development, specifically, the postfeeding and pupal stages.

We used a large comparative dataset to test several hypotheses proposed to explain the evolution of eggshell colouration. We tested the hypothesis that predation pressure might select for cryptic eggshells by examining the relationship between predation rate and egg colouration. We found that predation rates were positively related to eggshell brightness. The blackmail hypothesis suggests that females lay colourful eggshells to coerce males into providing additional care during incubation to keep colourful eggs covered. According to this hypothesis, conspicuous eggs should be found in situations with high risk of visual detection from predators or brood parasites. In support of this hypothesis, proportional blue-green chroma was positively related to parasitism risk, and eggs with higher proportional blue-green chroma or higher ultraviolet chroma received higher combined parental nest attendance during the incubation period. The sexual signalling hypothesis states that blue-green colour indicates female quality; however, we did not find that blue-green eggshell colour was greater in species where males participate in any form of parental care, and relative male provisioning was unrelated to blue-green eggshell chroma. We found some support for the hypothesis that brood parasitism may select for high inter-clutch variation in eggshell colour to facilitate egg recognition. In our dataset, parasitism risk was negatively related to inter-clutch repeatability of blue-green chroma. Our study highlights the diversity of selection pressures acting on the evolution of eggshell colour in birds and provides suggestions for novel areas of future key research direction. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Blackmail hypothesis | Egg colour | Egg recognition | Evolution | Parasitism | Predation | Sexual signalling hypothesis,15,0,,undefined,Field Museum

The nucleolar organizer region (NOR), visible as an especially large puff, shrinks when a larva is at particular developmental stages or is subjected to chemical stress. However, whether reduced NOR size is indicative of reduced growth is unknown. Therefore, we conducted 2 experiments to examine the relationship between NOR size and chironomid growth under controlled laboratory conditions. In the 1 st experiment, we quantified the effect of ration quality on larval growth and NOR size. In the 2nd, we determined whether NOR size varied as a function of recent growth, independently of larval size. The combined results demonstrated that NOR size varied as a function of prepupal development and was positively correlated with a chironomid's most recent growth rate, independently of its biomass. The finding that NOR size is related to growth validates its use as a biomarker of sublethal stress. NOR size also has potential value as a measure of instantaneous growth state of field-collected larvae and, thus, may provide a surrogate measure useful for estimating secondary production in natural populations. © 2013 by The Society for Freshwater Science.",biomarker | Chironomidae | chromosome | growth | nucleolar organizer region | polytene | puff,0,0,,undefined,

Here, we describe patterns of geographic variation in the song of rufous-naped wrens Campylorhynchus rufinucha. This species complex is a morphologically variable taxon confined to tropical dry forest areas from Mexico to northwestern Costa Rica. Morphological and genetic analyses suggest that there are at least three partially isolated groups within the complex, including a secondary-contact zone in coastal western Chiapas between the subspecies C. r. humilus and C. r. nigricaudatus. Based on recordings throughout their geographic range, we investigate the effects of historical isolation on song structure and analyze whether genetic differences or climatic conditions explain observed patterns of variation. Our findings, based on a culturally-transmitted and sexually-selected trait, support the hypothesis that three evolutionary units exist within this taxon. Our results suggest that song differences between genetic groups were influenced by historical isolation. We report a strong relationship between vocal dissimilarity and genetic distance, suggesting that differences in vocal characteristics are probably affected by the same factors that drive genetic divergence. We argue that the evolution of song in this taxon is influenced by vicariant events, followed by accumulation of changes in song structure due to several possible factors: cultural drift in song structure; genetic drift in features related to song production; or natural selection acting on features that influence songs, such as body and beak size. © 2013 The Authors.

The Burbot Lota lota is a freshwater codfish that spawns in a light-limited, under-ice environment. Both sexes possess swim bladder muscles, suggesting that both sexes engage in vocalization and that auditory cues are important to their mating system, but research on acoustic communication has been very limited in this species. In the current study we assessed the hearing sensitivity of Burbot from different size-classes. Burbot hearing was found to be more sensitive in juveniles than in adults, but across size-classes it was most sensitive at lower frequencies, which is similar to results with other codfishes and corresponds to the sounds produced by gadoids. Anthropogenic noise has the potential to disturb fish. The information gained in this study can be useful in assessing the impact of such noise, particularly under ice cover when Burbot are spawning. Further research is required to determine whether winter-based resource development activities that generate under-ice noise are disruptive to Burbot communication and reproduction.

By managing a vector, an entire assemblage of associated NIS is simultaneously considered. The majority of current risk assessment frameworks have been conducted for a single, or selected few, target species and thus are not useful for managing vectors transporting a large number of potentially unknown species. Here we develop a predictive framework to assess relative invasion risk for a vector (ballast water) transporting an unknown species assemblage, using the Canadian Arctic as a case study. Ballast water discharge is a known high-risk vector globally, but its magnitude in the Arctic has not been well characterized. Our framework determined relative invasion risks between different transit pathways by quantifying the probability of NIS successfully transiting all stages of the invasion process and the magnitude of consequences of introduction to those ports. Churchill, Manitoba was ranked at 'higher' invasion risk via ballast water discharged by international merchant vessels than any other recipient port studied. The overall pattern of ballast water discharge suggests that water originating from coastal domestic sources carried by international merchant vessels may be important for dispersal of NIS. In addition, ballast-mediated NIS are more likely to arrive to the Hudson Bay region during summer months. These results can be useful for developing prevention and early detection programs for the region. Our risk assessment framework is not limited to ballast water and could be applied to other vectors for effective management of NIS. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Arctic | Ballast water | Biological invasions | Climate change | Risk prediction | Vector management,33,0,,CGSD2,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, have two ARTs: large males that participate in dominance-based hierarchies for access to spawning females, known as hooknoses, and small males that attempt to sneak fertilizations during spawning events from peripheral positions, known as jacks. Jacks continually face sperm competition risk because they always spawn in the presence of another male, whereas hooknoses face relatively low sperm competition risk because other males are not always present during spawning events. Based on the sneak-guard model of sperm competition this asymmetry in sperm competition risk predicts that jacks ought to invest significantly more into sperm-related traits important for sperm competition success relative to hooknoses. In the present study we report on reproductive investment patterns, sperm characteristics, and seminal plasma physiology of males that exhibit ARTs in Chinook salmon. We found that jacks invest significantly more of their somatic tissue into gonads compared with hooknoses. Sperm velocity also varied significantly between the ARTs, with jacks having significantly faster sperm than hooknoses. No significant differences in seminal plasma physiology metrics related to sperm quality were detected between the ARTs. We interpret these sperm investment patterns in light of the sneak-guard model of sperm competition that is based on differences in sperm competition risk and alternative investment possibilities among ARTs. © 2012 The Linnean Society of London.",Adenosine 5'-triphosphate | Gonadosomatic index | Salmon | Sneak-guard hypothesis | Sperm competition | Sperm morphology | Sperm velocity,24,1,,undefined,

Given that thiamine deficiency has been observed in almost all of the top predators in Lake Ontario, we assessed the potential that adiet-induced thiamine deficiency associated with consumption ofAlewives Alosa pseudoharengus could be involved. Muscle thiamine was measured in eels from throughout the LOUSL corridor and was compared with putative threshold effect levels established from the literature. Mirex concentrations were used to separate Lake Ontario-resident eels from non-Lake Ontario-resident eels.Stable isotope analyses of eel muscle samples and potential prey, including Alewives, were combined with mixing model softwareto infer the diets consumed by Lake Ontario eels. Although residence in Lake Ontario was associated with a significant declinein muscle thiamine concentration, estimated Alewife consumptionby eels was unexpectedly low. Instead, mixing model results indicated that crayfish and Round Goby Neogobius melanostomus werethe major prey. Both taxa are known to contain thiaminase and have the potential to cause thiamine deficiency, but there are no reports of thiamine deficiency associated with Round Goby consumption, thus implicating crayfish. There was no recovery in thiamine levels prior to the initiation of oceanic migration. Asa result, thiamine levels of Lake Ontario-resident eels prior to migration were only slightly above putative threshold effect levels for pathological and behavioral effects in Japanese EelsAnguilla japonica, but this would require confirmation with American Eels. Since thiamine levels are expected to decline further during migration, additional effects on eel behavior, reproduction, and survival seem probable. Because of panmixia, such effects—when combined with the relatively high reproductive potential of Lake Ontario-resident eels—may have consequences for the entire species. © 2013 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,3,0,,undefined,

Using arrays of microphones, biologists can monitor the position of free-living animals based on the sounds they produce. Microphone array technology exploits differences in sound arrival times at each microphone to calculate an animal's position. This technology provides new opportunities for studying animal ecology and behaviour and has many advantages over tracking technologies that require capturing animals and fitting them with external devices, or technologies that focus on one individual in isolation of the activities of nearby animals. 2. The efficacy of microphone arrays for triangulating the position of wild animals has been established through previous studies. Yet widespread use of microphone array technology has been limited by many factors: arrays are expensive, custom manufactured, and cumbersome. Consequently, microphone arrays are used infrequently, in spite of their transformative potential for studying animal ecology and behaviour. 3. We conducted a field test of a new wireless microphone array system that has multiple advantages over previous systems: it is relatively inexpensive, commercially available, includes an integrated global positioning system (GPS) for time-synchronizing microphones, and it is small enough to fit in a backpack. We set up an array of four stereo recorders (each with a pair of stereo microphones) at 12 sites and tested the system's accuracy for estimating the location of loudspeakers broadcasting 25 types of bird, mammal and frog sounds. 4. We found that this system produced accurate location estimates based on multi-channel recordings of many types of acoustic signals. The average location accuracy was 1.87 ± 0.13 m, on par with cable-based microphone array systems. Location accuracy was significantly higher when the recorders were closer together and when sounds were broadcast inside the area bounded by the microphones. Accuracy tended to be higher in field vs. forest habitats. 5. We discuss how this system may be used to enhance studies of animal ecology and behaviour across a wide range of contexts. As with previous arrays, this system will allow researchers to monitor animals that produce distinctive acoustic signals. In contrast to previous microphone arrays, this system is affordable, portable and commercially available. Consequently, this system stands to dramatically enhance research on wild, free-living animals. © 2012 The Authors.

Radiotelemetry provides a tool for monitoring animals that are difficult to observe directly. Recent technical advances have given rise to new systems that present expanded opportunities for field research. We report the results of the first field test of Encounternet, a new digital radiotelemetry system comprising portable receiver stations and digital tags designed for long-term studies of the social behaviour and ecology of free-living animals. 2. We present results from a series of field tests designed to evaluate the utility of Encounternet for monitoring animals in a neotropical forest, with an emphasis on evaluating mate sampling behaviour in female long-tailed manakins. In this tropical species, females visit leks where males perform elaborate dances on horizontal perches. Females are highly cryptic in both plumage and activities, and therefore, Encounternet might provide unique insights into female behaviour and ecology. 3. Our first two tests revealed that pulse strength and probability of detection decrease with the distance between tag and receiver and that tags placed on a fixed perch near a receiver showed different patterns of reception than more distant tags. Our third test revealed that antenna angle had only a small influence on pulse strength. 4. Blind analysis of simulated bird movements confirmed that the Encounternet system provides reliable information on animal activity. Data from multiple receivers permitted accurate reconstruction of simulated bird movements. Tag detections showed low levels of false negatives and false positives. 5. Female manakins responded well to carrying Encounternet tags attached by an elastic leg harness. Birds flew well upon release and were detected for 7.5 ± 0.8 days after release. Recaptures and re-sightings of females were rare in our large study population, yet there were two occasions where we confirmed that the tag fell off within 1 year. 6. We conclude that Encounternet technology provides an effective tool for monitoring animal ecology and behaviour. We show that it is capable of providing accurate measures of distance and that it is a highly versatile system for studying the ecology and behaviour of free-living animals. We discuss the unique opportunities facilitated by this technology for future ecological and behavioural studies. © 2012 The Authors.

Based on eight years of data collected from populations in the Central Valley of Costa Rica, we describe White-eared Ground-sparrows' nests, eggs, nest parasitism, parental behavior, and breeding phenology. Nests conformed to one of two general types: (1) a bulky structure of plant fibres with a coarse outer layer and a fine inner layer; and (2) a smaller, simpler structure made up of a platform of thin plant fibres placed on top of rocks. Nest of the former type were located in vegetation near the ground, whereas the latter type were constructed directly on the ground. This is the first description of the second nest type. Eggs had a white background with variable brown spotting. Eggs were laid in clutches of two or three. Parasitism by Bronzed Cowbirds (Molothrus aeneus) was severe; five often nests were parasitized, including two that were multiply parasitized with 6 and 7 cowbird eggs. Only females were observed incubating the eggs, but both sexes provisioned nestlings; only females were observed provisioning fledglings while males assisted in locating food. This species has a long breeding season, begins in March (late dry season), and continues until September (late rainy season). We provide the first formal description of the breeding behaviour of White-eared Ground-sparrows, from a genus of birds whose behaviour is poorly known in the tropics. © The Neotropical Ornithological Society.",Breeding biology | Melozone leucotis | Nest architecture | Nest type description | Thicket habitat | White-eared Ground-sparrow,9,0,,undefined,

Through analysing paired δ 13C, total %C, δ 15N, total %N and C:N values of non-lipid extracted (BULK) and lipid extracted (LE) muscle samples from twenty-one elasmobranch species, we assessed whether lipid extraction was required: (i) to remove lipids given reported low lipid content and, (ii) to determine if δ 15N values were affected and whether this relates to the retention of isotopically light urea by elasmobranchs. The mean (±SD) δ 13C values of eight out of twenty-one species significantly increased following lipid extraction with two species, the Greenland (Somniosus microcephalus) and whale (Rhincodon typus) shark, showing a marked increase (5.0±0.4‰ and 3.3‰, respectively). The mean (±SD) and maximum increase in δ 13C values were 0.6±1.2‰ and 5.9‰, respectively. For δ 15N data, thirteen species showed a significant increase following lipid extraction and a concomitant reduction in total percent nitrogen (%N). The C:N ratio for these species also increased from unexpectedly low values of <3.0 to ~3.0, the value expected for pure protein. The mean and maximum observed increase in δ 15N values were 0.6±0.6‰ and 2.3‰, respectively. There was no effect of increasing animal size on δ 13C and δ 15N difference (LE-BULK) for the two species examined. Field sampled animals (sampled immediately upon capture in the marine environment) showed a greater δ 15N difference than animals sampled in the laboratory (sampled several hours after capture in the marine environment) (1.0±0.5‰ and 0.4±0.4‰ respectively), while estuarine sampled animals (sampled immediately) showed the smallest difference (0.1±0.6‰). The δ 13C data demonstrate that lipid extraction is required to remove lipids from elasmobranch muscle tissue given both intra- and inter- species variability. In addition, the increase in δ 15N values, decrease in %N and increase in C:N ratio indicate that lipid extraction is removing soluble urea. Given lower δ 15N diet-tissue discrimination factors for large marine predators, removal of urea is required to elucidate accurate trophic position estimates and relative food web position of elasmobranchs and for diet reconstruction. It is recommended that investigators undertake lipid extraction trials on elasmobranch muscle tissue to determine effects on δ 13C and δ 15N values on a species-by-species basis. © 2012.",Intra- and inter-species variability | Lipids | Sharks | Skate | Stable isotopes | Urea,38,0,,undefined,

Empirical studies suggest that many factors associated with these changes can lead to complex genetic patterns, particularly among invasive populations. However, genetic complexities and factors responsible for them remain uncharacterized in many cases. Here, we explore these issues in the vase tunicate Ciona intestinalis (Ascidiacea: Enterogona: Cionidae), a model species complex, of which spA and spB are rapidly spreading worldwide. We intensively sampled 26 sites (N = 873) from both coasts of North America, and performed phylogenetic and population genetics analyses based on one mitochondrial fragment (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3 -NADH dehydrogenase subunit I, COX3-ND1) and eight nuclear microsatellites. Our analyses revealed extremely complex genetic patterns in both species on both coasts. We detected a contrasting pattern based on the mitochondrial marker: two major genetic groups in C. intestinalis spA on the west coast versus no significant geographic structure in C. intestinalis spB on the east coast. For both species, geographically distant populations often showed high microsatellite-based genetic affinities whereas neighboring ones often did not. In addition, mitochondrial and nuclear markers provided largely inconsistent genetic patterns. Multiple factors, including random genetic drift associated with demographic changes, rapid selection due to strong local adaptation, and varying propensity for human-mediated propagule dispersal could be responsible for the observed genetic complexities. © 2012 The Authors.",Ciona intestinalis | Genetic complexity | Phylogeography | Population genetics | Selection/local adaptation | Solitary ascidian,32,1,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

One such gene family encodes the Skp1-like class of polypeptide subunits, where 21 genes have been identified and are known to be expressed in Arabidopsis. Phylogenetic analysis based on deduced polypeptide sequence organizes the family of ASK proteins into 7 clades. The complexity of the ASK gene family, together with the close structural similarity among its members raises the prospect of significant functional redundancy among select paralogs. We have assessed the potential for functional redundancy within the ASK gene family by analyzing an expanded set of criteria that define redundancy with higher resolution. The criteria used include quantitative expression of locus-specific transcripts using qRT-PCR, assessment of the sub-cellular localization of individual ASK:YFP auto-fluorescent fusion proteins expressed in vivo as well as the in planta assessment of individual ASK-F-Box protein interactions using bimolecular fluorescent complementation techniques in combination with confocal imagery in live cells. The results indicate significant functional divergence of steady state transcript abundance and protein-protein interaction specificity involving ASK proteins in a pattern that is poorly predicted by sequence-based phylogeny. The information emerging from this and related studies will prove important for defining the functional intersection of expression, localization and gene product interaction that better predicts the formation of discrete SCF complexes, as a prelude to investigating their molecular mode of action. © 2012 Dezfulian et al.",,17,1,,undefined,

Western blotting and immunohistochemical experiments were conducted to examine the expression of the two subunits over the IC including its central nucleus, dorsal cortex, and external cortex (ICc, ICd, and ICx). Results revealed that the two subunits existed in both cell bodies and the neuropil throughout the IC. The two subunits had similar regional distributions over the IC. The combined level of cell body and neuropil labeling was higher in the ICd than the other two subdivisions. Labeling in the ICc and ICx was stronger in the dorsal than the ventral regions. In spite of regional differences, no defined boundaries were formed between different areas. For both subunits, the regional distribution of immunoreactivity in the neuropil was parallel to that of combined immunoreactivity in the neuropil and cell bodies. The density of labeled cell bodies tended to be higher but sizes of cell bodies tended to be smaller in the ICd than in the other subdivisions. No systematic regional changes were found in the level of cell body immunoreactivity, except that GABAB R2-immunoreactive cell bodies in the ICd had slightly higher optic density (OD) than in other regions. Elongated cell bodies existed throughout the IC. Many labeled cell bodies along the outline of the IC were oriented in parallel to the outline. No strong tendency of orientation was found in labeled cell bodies in ICc. Regional distributions of the subunits in ICc correlated well with inputs to this subdivision. Our finding regarding the contrast in the level of neuropil immunoreactivity among different subdivisions is consistent with the fact that the GABAb receptor has different pre- and postsynaptic functions in different IC regions. © 2012 Jamal, Khan, Butt, PatelandZhang.",Auditory midbrain | Auditory system | GABA | GABA  receptor B | GABA R1 subunit B | GABA R2 subunit B | Hearing | Inhibition,10,1,,undefined,

This contrasts with the historical situation in Lake Ontario where δ 13C values of the lake trout population were dominated by a reliance on offshore carbon production. 5.These results indicate a reduced capacity of the Lake Ontario offshore food web to support the energetic requirements of lake trout and that this top predator has become increasingly reliant on prey resources that are derived from nearshore carbon pathways. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd and Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.",Nearshore | Neogobius melanostomus | Offshore | Salvelinus namaycush | Stable isotopes,38,0,,undefined,

For Canadian freshwater fishes, population genetic structure is largely reflective of dispersal from glacial refugia and isolation within drainage basins across a range of scales. Enhancement of sport fisheries via hatchery stocking programs and other means has the potential to alter signatures of natural evolutionary processes. Using 11 microsatellite loci genotyped from 2182 individuals, we analyzed the genetic structure of 46 inland lake walleye (Sander vitreus) populations spanning five major drainage basins within the province of Ontario, Canada. Population genetic analyses coupled with genotype assignment allowed us to: 1) characterize broad-and fine-scale genetic structure among Ontario walleye populations; and 2) determine if the observed population divergence is primarily due to natural or historical processes, or recent anthropogenic events. The partitioning of genetic variation revealed higher genetic divergence among lakes than among drainage basins or proposed ancestries-indicative of relatively high isolation among lakes, study-wide. Walleye genotypes were clustered into three major groups, likely reflective of Missourian, Mississippian, and Atlantic glacial refugial ancestry. Despite detectable genetic signatures indicative of anthropogenic influences, province-wide spatial genetic structure remains consistent with the hypothesis of dispersal from distinct glacial refugia and subsequent isolation of lakes within primary drainage basins.

The Herring Gull Monitoring Programme has documented changes in contaminant levels found in herring gull Larus argentatus Pontoppidan eggs across the Great Lakes for nearly 40 years. We measured the coloration of these eggs using reflectance spectrophotometry and evaluated the influence of a suite of contaminants on egg colour using general linear mixed models. Herring gull egg coloration was related to the levels of environmental contaminants found within the eggs. Our findings reveal a negative association between blue-green chroma and a principal component explaining contaminant load. We also found that ultraviolet chroma varied positively with contaminant load, whereas brown chroma was not significantly related to contaminant load. In addition, a cross-validated discriminant function analysis was able to correctly classify 84% of eggs to either high or low contaminant load. This is an important first step in assessing the utility of using egg coloration as a proxy for contaminant load in a colonially breeding waterbird. Synthesis and applications. Our study utilized a large, multi-year data set to provide the first evidence that a suite of environmental contaminants appear to influence avian eggshell coloration. We also found that objective spectrophotometric measurements provide a reliable tool for assessment of egg contaminant load, and we provide a discriminant function for contaminant classification directly in the field. Our findings should be broadly relevant, because the pigments responsible for avian egg coloration are shared across all birds. The application of eggshell colour as a bio-monitoring tool has important conservation and management applications; measuring egg coloration may provide a rapid, inexpensive and nondestructive means of estimating contaminant levels in the environment. This may provide an essential tool for monitoring areas or species of concern, as well as evaluating potential human health risks, by identifying populations supported by an environment that requires more attention and potentially environmental remediation. © 2012 The Authors.

Often these signals can be sufficient to ward off potential rivals, thus minimizing the chance of injury due to physical encounters. Yet not all behaviours produced during territorial interactions are aggressive signals. In this investigation, we examined the aggressive signals of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, by determining which signals predict attack on a competitor. We used a recently developed playback protocol involving a loudspeaker and a taxidermic mount to simulate an intruder on males' breeding territories. We examined males' behaviours prior to any physical attack on the mount, both in the minute before attack and the time period preceding this minute. In the minute before attack, we found that gargle calls consistently predicted attack. In the preceding time period, we found that high song rate predicted attack. Surprisingly, we found that attack and the behaviours associated with attack were not significantly correlated with male dominance status. We conclude that song rate and gargle calling behaviour communicate intent to attack during territorial interactions in black-capped chickadees. These results expand our knowledge of aggressive signals during territorial encounters by revealing novel vocalizations used to communicate an animal's probability to attack an opponent. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Animal communication | Black-capped chickadee | Frequency matching | Gargle call | Overlapping | Poecile atricapillus | Signal reliability | Song rate,25,0,,undefined,Queen's University

The resulting audiograms are typically presented in terms of sound pressure (dB re. 1 μPa) with the particle motion (dB re. 1 m s-2) component largely ignored until recently. When audiograms have been presented in terms of particle acceleration, one of two approaches has been used for stimulus characterisation: measuring the pressure gradient between two hydrophones or using accelerometers. With rare exceptions these values are presented from experiments using a speaker as the stimulus, thus making it impossible to truly separate the contribution of direct particle motion and pressure detection in the response. Here, we compared the particle acceleration and pressure auditory thresholds of three species of fish with differing hearing specialisations, goldfish (Carassius auratus, weberian ossicles), bigeye (Pempheris adspersus, ligamentous hearing specialisation) and a third species with no swim bladder, the common triplefin (Forstergyian lappillum), using three different methods of determining particle acceleration. In terms of particle acceleration, all three fish species have similar hearing thresholds, but when expressed as pressure thresholds goldfish are the most sensitive, followed by bigeye, with triplefin the least sensitive. It is suggested here that all fish have a similar ability to detect the particle motion component of the sound field and it is their ability to transduce the pressure component of the sound field to the inner ear via ancillary hearing structures that provides the differences in hearing ability. Therefore, care is needed in stimuli presentation and measurement when determining hearing ability of fish and when interpreting comparative hearing abilities between species. © 2012.

Location Paraná-Uruguay-Río de la Plata watershed in Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. Methods We performed genetic analyses based on a comprehensive sampling strategy encompassing 22 populations (N=712) throughout the invaded range in South America, using the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and eight polymorphic nuclear microsatellites. We employed both population genetics and phylogenetic analyses to clarify the dispersal dynamics and population genetic structure. Results We detected relatively high genetic differentiation between populations (F ST=-0.041 to 0.111 for COI, -0.060 to 0.108 for microsatellites) at both fine and large geographical scales. Bayesian clustering and three-dimensional factorial correspondence analyses consistently revealed two genetically distinct clusters, highlighting genetic discontinuities in the invaded range. Results of all genetic analyses suggest ship-mediated 'jump' dispersal as the dominant mode of spread of golden mussels in South America, while downstream natural dispersal has had limited effects on contemporary genetic patterns. Main conclusions Our study provides new evidence that post-establishment dispersal dynamics and genetic patterns vary across geographical scales. While ship-mediated 'jump' dispersal dominates post-establishment spread of golden mussels in South America, once colonies become established in upstream locations, larvae produced may be advected downstream to infill patchy distributions. Moreover, genetic structuring at fine geographical scales, especially within the same drainages, suggests a further detailed understanding of dynamics of larval dispersal and settlement in different water systems. Knowledge of the mechanisms by which post-establishment spread occurs can, in some cases, be used to limit dispersal of golden mussels and other introduced species. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Biological invasions | Dispersal mechanism | Genetic differentiation | Golden mussel Limnoperna fortunei | Non-indigenous species | Population structure,28,0,,undefined,

Inconsistent survival and growth performance in triploid fish, however, has limited their implementation. In our study, ocean-type Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were bred using replicated 3×3 factorial mating designs to create 18 families to test whether triploidization resulted in changes in growth and ionoregulation performance in freshwater and seawater. Eggs were pressure shocked after fertilization to create triploid offspring in a subset of each family. In spring, freshwater fish were sampled for size and gill Na +, K +-ATPase activity. Plasma chloride and cortisol were measured following a 24-h saltwater challenge. Growth performance was monitored for a further four months following transfer to sea water. We found significant effects of ploidy and sire (paternal effect) on smolt weight, as well as on gill Na +, K +-ATPase activity, although the latter did not correspond with performance in a 24-h saltwater challenge. Following four months of ocean growth, diploid animals were consistently larger, with greater circulating levels of insulin-like growth factor-1 than triploid sibs, although specific growth rates did not differ. Conversely, gill Na +, K +-ATPase activity at that time was significantly higher in triploid than diploid fish. When the phenotypic variance for the various traits was partitioned, triploids exhibited significantly greater additive genetic variance and maternal effects across all traits relative to diploid fish - indicating that gene dosage effects were primarily additive. The strong family effect indicates that genotype has a substantial role in determining the effects of ploidy manipulation on ionoregulatory and growth performance in Chinook salmon. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.","Additive genetic variance | Gill | Growth | IGF-1 | Na  , K  -ATPase + + | Triploid",15,0,,undefined,

Winter season represents an especially challenging time of year for this Holarctic species as it is characterized by a shortage of basic resources and is when most industrial development occurs, to which caribou can perceive as increased predation risk. To investigate the impact of industrial features on caribou, we developed a spatially explicit, agent-based model (ABM) to simulate the underlying behavioral mechanisms caribou are most likely to employ when navigating their landscape in winter. The ABM model is composed of cognitive caribou agents possessing memory and decision-making heuristics that act to optimize tradeoffs between energy acquisition and predator/disturbance avoidance. A set of environmental data layers was used to develop a virtual grid representing the landscape in terms of forage availability, energy content, and predation-risk. The model was calibrated with caribou bio-energetic values from literature sources, and validated using GPS data from thirteen caribou radio-collars deployed over 6 months from 2004 to 2005. Simulations were conducted on alternative caribou habitat-selection strategies by assigning different fitness-maximizing goals to agents. The model outcomes were evaluated using a pattern-oriented modeling approach with actual caribou data. The scenario in which the caribou agent must trade off the mutually competing goals of obtaining its daily energy requirement, conserving reproductive energy, and minimizing predation risk, was found to be the best-fit scenario. Not recognizing industrial features as risk causes simulated caribou to unrealistically reduce their daily and landscape movements; equally, having risk take precedence results in unrealistic energetic deficits and large-scale movement patterns, unlike those observed in actual caribou. These results elucidate the most likely behavioral strategies caribou use to select their winter habitat, the relative extent to which they perceive industry features as potential predation, and the differential energetic costs associated with each strategy. They can assist future studies of how caribou may respond to continued industrial development and/or mitigation measures. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.",Agent-based model | Animal movement | Bioenergetics | Caribou | Habitat use | Industry features,15,0,,SSII-102,Alberta Innovates

For birds, Dgo′/Dog ranged from 2.9 to 6.3 and for fish the ratios ranged from 0.7 to 3.1. In both species, the ratio commonly exceeded 1. The GI-magnification model was used to predict maximum PCB biomagnification factors (BMFmax) for each species which ranged from 18.5 to 33.8 for ring doves and 7.9 to 14.8 for Japanese koi.

We used both an observational and experimental approach to study signal timing in lekking tropical birds. We recorded duetting pairs of male long-tailed manakins, Chiroxiphia linearis, during periods when two neighbouring pairs were calling concurrently, and during playback of a simulated pair of nearby rival males. We used three complementary analytical techniques to evaluate whether birds varied the timing of their duet calls relative to nearby animals: circular statistics, resampling analysis and duty cycle models. Our analyses reveal that long-tailed manakins produce duets with nonrandom timing with respect to the calls of their rivals. During natural bouts of concurrent calling, all three analytical techniques revealed that manakins time their duets to avoid overlap. In response to playback, males showed more variable strategies. Males overlapped duets more during playback than they did under natural conditions and, in some cases, they overlapped playback duets at higher levels than would be expected based on chance. Our study shows that males alter the timing of their calls in response to the vocalizations of others around them, and it uncovers similarities in the acoustic signalling behaviour of lekking birds relative to the better-studied signalling behaviour of territorial birds.

Transcription of four cytokine genes (IL1, TNF-α, IL-8, IL8-R) and two control genes (IgM and RPS-11) was measured relative to an endogenous control (EF1a) before and 24 h after immune stimulation with Vibrio vaccine. Additive genetic variation was not significant for cytokine transcription and heritability ranged from 0.44 (in pre-challenge IL1) to 0.04 (in post-challenge TNF-α). Non-additive genetic variance was significant in postchallenge IL1 (18 %) and TNF-α (12 %) while maternal effects contributed to pre-challenge cytokine transcription. Cytokine transcription co-expressed within but not between pre- and post-challenge states. The lack of additive genetic effects indicates that cytokine transcription is not a likely candidate for selection programs to improve immune function in Chinook salmon. Our results add to the growing evidence that non-additivity in salmon is common and contributes to our understanding of the genetic architecture of transcription. This indicates that transcription variation may act to maintain genetic variation and facilitate rapid adaptive response in salmonids. © Springer-Verlag 2012.",Chinook salmon | Cytokines | Gene expression | Immune system | Maternal effects | Non-additive genetic effects | Quantitative genetics,19,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

We explored the presence and species diversity of adult macroinvertebrates transported by transoceanic and coastal vessels arriving to ports on the Atlantic coast of Canada. We sampled 67 ballast tanks from 62 ships operating along discrete geographic pathways and tested whether mid-ocean exchange or voyage length affects the probability for translocation of macroinvertebrates. Additionally, we assessed the relationship between macroinvertebrate presence and the amount of sediment in ballast tanks. We document the presence of highly invasive European green crab (Carcinus maenas), mud crab (Rhithropanopeus harrisii), common periwinkle (Littorina littorea), soft shell clam (Mya arenaria) and blue mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis) in ballast tanks of surveyed ships. Mid-ocean exchange did not affect macroinvertebrate occurrence, suggesting that current ballast water management regulations are ineffective for this taxonomic group. Viable individuals were recorded in vessels undertaking shorter voyages (average and maximum of 4.5 and 15 days, respectively) and presence was not related to the amount of sediment in tanks. While presence and densities of macroinvertebrates were low, invasion risk may nonetheless be significant during reproductive seasons owing to high fecundity of some taxa. The highest risk may be posed by decapods since gravid females may carry thousands to several million eggs per clutch, and after several weeks of brooding, two or more subsequent clutches may be fertilized by retained sperm from an earlier mating. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Ballast tanks | Crab | High fecundity | Mollusc | Non-indigenous species | Propagule pressure,52,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Under mesophilic conditions (37°C) and an initial pH value of 6.0, higher H 2 yields were observed for the flocculated cultures when compared to the granular cultures. The maximum yield for granular cultures treated acid, BESA or LA were statistically the same. Butyric acid fermentation was dominant in a majority of the treated cultures. The maximum hydrogenase evolution specific activity (ESA) (124 ± 8 U e mg VSS -1) at 37°C correlated with the maximum H 2 yield for the LA treated flocculated cultures (1.69 ± 0.18 mol mol -1 glucose). The microbial diversity data clearly showed that the low H 2 yield in the granular cultures was due to the lower proportion of H 2 producers.

To more effectively manage and protect coastal biodiversity, accurate assessments of genetic, species, and ecosystem level diversity are required. We present the results from an assessment of the aquatic species diversity of a small (3 km 2), shallow, mangrove-fringed Bahamian lagoon (the North Sound) subject to ongoing anthropogenic development. The assessment was conducted through a collation of field observations and data in published literature. We found that eight angiosperm species, 30 macroalgal species, and 370 animal species (including 95 fishes, 69 arthropods, 56 birds, and 45 mollusks) were documented within the lagoon. At least 11 of these species are of conservation concern, such as the critically endangered smalltooth sawfish (Pristis pectinata) and hawksbill turtle (Eretmochelys imbricata). Comparisons of community similarity indicated that the North Sound has a relatively distinct fauna and flora, but available data suggest that the species found there are most similar to those found in nearby habitats in Cuba. The lagoon forms a key nursery habitat for many species, including lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris), Caribbean spiny lobsters (Panulirus argus), and queen conch (Strombas gigas). Recently, the lagoon was included as part of a new marine protected area (MPA), but much of the habitat has already experienced considerable anthropogenic disturbance and the MPA boundaries have yet to be established. We have therefore analyzed the lagoon biodiversity and expect the data presented here to serve as a baseline for future comparisons. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Aquatic biodiversity | Bahamas | Lagoon | Mangroves | Marine protected area | Seagrass,10,0,,NSF-OCE 97– 12793,National Science Foundation

We present the first detailed descriptions of the song and singing behaviours of six species of bulbul in the genus Pycnonotus, based on recordings of birds in mixed-species flocks in the tropical forests of northern Thailand. All six species are frugivores that often forage together in the same fruiting tree. We compared nine fine structural features of the songs of these species to understand the vocal behaviour of each and the potential importance of vocalisations in species recognition in these mixed-species flocks. Our analyses reveal substantial differences in the structure of songs as well as marked differences in singing behaviour between species. Discriminant function analysis readily distinguishes the songs of the six species based on structural differences. Discriminant function analysis of species with the most similar plumage features (as assessed by human observers) readily distinguishes between phenotypically similar pairs of congeners. Our results provide evidence that vocalisations may be important in species recognition and as species-isolating mechanisms between closely related and sympatric Pycnonotus bulbuls. The species-typical features described here may be helpful to biologists and conservationists, particularly as several species of bulbul are of conservation concern. © 2012 BirdLife Australia.",bird song | mixed-species flocks | Pycnonotidae | species recognition.,0,0,,undefined,

Castor also has tremendous future potential as an industrial oilseed crop because of its high seed oil content (more than 480 g kg-1), unique fatty acid composition (900 g kg-1 of ricinoleic acid), potentially high oil yields (1250-2500 L ha-1), and ability to be grown under drought and saline conditions.

The capacity for eavesdroppers to combine information gathered from overhearing multiple two-way interactions is poorly studied. We tested whether inexperienced (second year) and older (after second year) male black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) eavesdrop on rivals' song contests to evaluate the relative threat levels of multiple unfamiliar territorial intruders. We used a multiple speaker playback experiment to simulate 3 male territorial intruders (A, B, and C) engaging in 2 successive dyadic song contests, presenting focal males with the information that A was more threatening than B, and B was more threatening than C. We then assayed the response of focal males when presented with simulated intruders A and C without relative information. We predicted that males would defend against the intruder perceived to be the greater threat. Focal males initially responded toward the more threatening intruder (A) significantly more than the less threatening intruder (C), consistent with our predictions. Older birds approached the more threatening intruder (A) significantly more than the less threatening intruder (C), whereas young males showed more variable responses. Our results suggest that male chickadees were able to acquire relative threat information from separate song contests that influenced their responses toward rivals paired in novel contests.

Elucidating the factors that shape species distributions has long been a fundamental goal in ecology and evolutionary biology. In spite of significant theoretical advancements, empirical studies of range limits have lagged behind. Specifically, little is known about how the attributes that allow species to expand their ranges and become widespread vary across phylogenies. Here, we studied the ascidian Botryllus schlosseri, a worldwide invasive species that is also characterized by marked genetic subdivision. Our study includes phylogenetic and population genetic data based on mitochondrial and nuclear genes, as well as polymorphic microsatellites for B. schlosseri colonies sampled from the southern and northern coasts of Europe and the eastern and western coasts of North America. We demonstrate that this wellknown model organism comprises three highly divergent and probably reproductively isolated cryptic species (A, D and E), with two more (B and C) being suggested by data retrieved from GenBank. Among these, species A, recovered in all of the surveyed regions, is by far the most common and widespread. By contrast, species B–E, occurring mostly in sites from northern Europe, are considerably more geographically restricted. These findings, along with inferences made on transport opportunity, suggest that divergent evolutionary histories promoted differences in invasive potential between B. schlosseri sibling species, indicating that attributes that facilitate dramatic shifts in range limits can evolve more easily and frequently than previously thought. We propose environmental disturbance as a selective force that could have shaped the evolution of invasiveness in the B. schlosseri complex.",Biological invasions | Botryllus schlosseri | Cryptic speciation | Golden star tunicate | Invasiveness | Range limit,51,1,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

We found that silver and northern brook lampreys are not reciprocally monophyletic; two lineages were observed but each occurred within both species. There also were no significant range-wide differences in RFLP haplotype or microsatellite allele frequencies between the species, nor were there significant differences where they occurred sympatrically within the Lake Huron basin. Significant genetic differentiation was found only within the Lake Michigan basin where the results were potentially confounded by geographic separation. Our results thus support suggestions that silver and northern brook lampreys represent ecotypes of a single species since, where they are sympatric, they appear to be experiencing ongoing gene flow. However, alternative life history strategies can be important for a species' long-term persistence, and critical data are needed to decide whether these two feeding types should be managed as a single unit. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Brook lampreys | Conservation | DNA barcode | Ecotypes | Microsatellites | Species pairs,23,0,,undefined,Great Lakes Fishery Commission

The potential for hybridization through reproductive interactions between escaped farmed and wild salmon can have significant impacts on the fitness and genetic composition of the natural population. Reproductive success of farmed male salmon in the wild will depend on their ability to compete for mates; however, it will also depend on their relative sperm performance, given that sperm competition is known to contribute to salmonid reproductive success. Farming practices, including the hormonal sex-reversal of females to create homogametic (XX) males, may have effects on sperm traits in salmon. We therefore analyzed sperm traits of XX farmed, XY farmed and wild Chinook salmon males during the spawning season. No significant difference was found between XX and XY farmed males for all sperm traits, except sperm density, which was significantly higher in XY males than XX males. XX and XY farmed males had significantly higher sperm motility and sperm velocity compared to wild males. In addition, wild males had lower sperm longevity and sperm density compared to farmed males. Our results indicate that farming practices may lead to increased sperm performance in Chinook salmon males. While we did not evaluate reproductive success resulting from spawning interactions in the wild, our results do highlight the potential for substantial introgression resulting from male-male competition between farmed and wild Chinook salmon in the wild. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..",Chinook salmon | Escapes | Farmed | Reproductive interactions | Sperm traits | Wild,18,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

Reproductive females were attracted to the unimodal stimuli, but when they were presented with multimodal stimuli, they spent significantly more time in the area of stimulus presentation than they did when they were presented with either stimulus alone. Nonreproductive females showed no enhancement of their response to multimodal stimulation and often failed to respond to any signals. Our results show that female gobies may cycle in their attraction and localization abilities to male stimuli throughout the breeding season and that reproductive females have a synergistic response to multimodal stimuli from reproductive males. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Auditory | Enhanced response | Multisensory | Neogobius melanostomus | Olfactory | Pheromone | Round goby,10,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Most such studies, however, have addressed species of the North Temperate Zone; tropical species are grossly underrepresented, although most of Earth's biodiversity is concentrated in the tropics. In this study, we describe the genetic mating strategy of the Rufous-and-white Wren (Thryothorus rufalbus), a socially monogamous duetting neotropical songbird. Over 8 years of studying a marked population in Costa Rica, we recorded genetic data from 51 broods. Microsatellite analysis of four variable loci revealed that the Rufous-and-white Wren follows a mixed reproductive strategy, where extra-pair young are found in a small minority of broods. Three of 158 nestlings (2%) were the result of extra-pair fertilizations; three of the 51 broods (6%) contained a nestling with alleles mismatched to its social father. We assigned paternity of two of the extra-pair nestlings to males in territories adjacent to the cuckolded males. During behavioral observations, we observed within-pair copulations rarely and extra-pair copulations never. The rate of extra-pair paternity we report here is lower than the average reported for socially monogamous birds in the North Temperate Zone but comparable to rates in three closely related tropical wrens. Rufous-and-white Wrens are renowned for their coordinated vocal duets. We compared rates of extra-pair paternity among socially monogamous tropical birds, contrasting four duetting species against twelve nonduetting species and found lower levels of extra-pair paternity in the former group, suggesting that duetting and low levels of extra-pair paternity are related. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2012.",Extra-pair paternity | Mating systems | Rufous-and-white Wren | Thryothorus rufalbus | Tropical birds | Vocal duets,21,0,,undefined,

We assessed community dynamics in stream sediments and interstitial pore water over a two-year period using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism. Here, we show that sediments remained saturated despite months of drought and limited hydrologic connectivity. The intermittency of stream surface water affected interstitial pore water communities more than hyporheic sediment communities. Seasonal changes in bacterial community composition was significantly associated with water intermittency, phosphate concentrations, temperature, nitrate and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations. During periods of low- to no-surface water, communities changed from being rich in operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in isolated surface pools, to a few OTUs overall, including an overall decline in both common and rare taxa. Individual OTUs were compared between porewater and sediments. A total of 19% of identified OTUs existed in both porewater and sediment samples, suggesting that bacteria use hyporheic sediments as a type of refuge from dessication, transported through hydrologically connected pore spaces. Stream intermittency impacted bacterial diversity on rapid timescales (that is, within days), below-ground and in the hyporheic zone. Owing to the coupling of intermittent streams to the surrounding watershed, we stress the importance of understanding connectivity at the pore scale, consequences for below-ground and above-ground biodiversity and nutrient processing, and across both short- and long-time periods (that is, days to months to years). © 2012 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.",bacterial communities | hyporheic zone | intermittent streams | operational taxonomic unit (OTU) | stream sediments | terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP),50,1,,undefined,Comparative Gastroenterology Society

In this study, we use an integrative approach to study sexual selection by incorporating measures of both mechanisms using the redside dace, . Clinostomus elongatus, a freshwater, externally fertilizing fish found in streams of eastern North America. We measured the success of individual male redside dace in both pre- and postspawning sexual selection and related the success of males to a range of traits, including spectral properties and the size of their red spawning coloration, body size metrics and sperm quality. We found significant sexual dimorphism in the relative amount and spectral properties (saturation and brightness) of the red spawning coloration, with males being more ornamented than females. Using dichotomous mate choice trials, we found that females did not favour males with relatively larger red spawning coloration area and more saturated or brighter red spawning coloration. Males with relatively more red spawning area would be favoured in male-male postspawning sperm competition because they possess sperm with higher velocity, and sperm velocity was determined to be the key predictor of sperm competition success as assessed by paternity analyses related to in vitro sperm competition trials. These results suggest that prespawning selection via female choice is not driving the evolution of red spawning coloration and that postspawning selection via male-male competition is primarily determined by sperm velocity, which was correlated with the relative amount of red spawning coloration. © 2012 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Carotenoid | Clinostomus elongatus | Female choice | Male-male competition | Minnow | Ornamentation | Paternity | Sexual selection | Sperm competition,21,0,,undefined,

Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a globally ubiquitous class of persistent organic contaminants that have been linked to reproductive impairments in fish. The authors used female brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) to test whether acclimation of reproductive life-history traits occurs in response to changes in sum PCB exposure. They compared egg diameter, gonadosomatic index (GSI), and fecundity of fish directly caught from wild populations exposed to a range of contaminant concentrations (acute), to those collected from the same populations a year before, which were placed in a clean environment to clear their contaminants throughout that year (cleared). Sum PCB concentrations were also determined for each individual. Brown bullhead from acute treatments had significantly greater sum PCB concentrations compared with cleared treatments. Egg diameter and GSI metrics were greater in cleared treatments compared with acute treatments (by 6 and 14%, respectively). Treatment effect (i.e., acute or cleared), as opposed to where the fish were collected from, accounts for 72 to 89% of the variation in the reproductive life-history trait variables. No difference in fecundity was found between acute and cleared treatments. The authors found support that acclimation of reproductive life-history traits occurs to changes in sum PCB concentration.

An oddball stimulus paradigm was used to study the sensitivity of ensembles of neurons in the ICd to novel sounds. Our recordings indicate that neuron ensembles in the ICd display stimulus-specific adaptation when a large contrast in both frequency and probability of occurrence exists between the two tone bursts used for generating an oddball paradigm. A local field potential evoked by a tone burst presented as a deviant stimulus has a larger amplitude than that evoked by the same sound presented as a standard stimulus. The difference between the two responses occurs after the initial rising phases of their predominant deflections. The degree of stimulus-specific adaptation increases with the rate of sound presentation up to 8/s, the highest rate used in this study. A comparison between our results and those from previous studies suggests that differences exist between responses to oddball paradigms in the ICd and those in the primary auditory cortex, a major source of projection to the ICd. These differences suggest that local mechanisms exist in the ICd for suppressing neural responses to frequently presented sounds and enhancing responses to rarely presented sounds. Thus, the ICd may serve as an important component of an integrative circuit in the brain for detecting novel sounds in the acoustic environment. © 2012 Elsevier B.V..",,24,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

We investigated the influence of density, fighter male presence, and major histocompatibility (MH) genotype on patterns of fertilization success in sneaker Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar). At low density and in the absence of fighter males, monopolization by single sneaker males occurred, suggesting that male-male competition was the main determinant of fertilization success. By contrast, at high density and (or) in the presence of fighter males, several sneakers succeeded in fertilizing eggs. Our study, the first to investigate the role of MHmediated fertilization for a genetically based alternative male mating strategy, suggests that a larger proportion of eggs were fertilized by sneakers whose MH genotypes were more similar to those of the female than expected by chance.

Zebrafish were trained to respond to either a 400 Hz or a 1000 Hz tone, and behavioral thresholds were then measured to tones from 200 to 1000 Hz. Significant threshold differences existed between the behavioral audiograms, with fish from each set most sensitive to their conditioned frequency.

As yolk utilization progresses via metabolic activity, there is a potential to realize further increases in POP concentrations if yolk lipids are depleted at a faster rate than POPs, a condition referred to as bioamplification. This study investigated the bioamplification of POPs in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) eggs and larvae. Chinook eggs were sampled from the Credit River, ON, Canada, and brought to an aquaculture facility where they were fertilized, incubated, and maintained posthatch until maternally derived lipid reserves became depleted (approximately 168 days). The loss of chemicals having an octanol-water partition coefficient (log KOW) greater than 5.8 was slow to negligible from days 0-135. However, during the increase in water temperatures in early spring, KOW-dependent elimination of POPs was observed. Bioamplification was maximized for the highest log KOW POPs, with an approximate 5-fold increase in lipid equivalents concentrations in 168 day old larvae as compared to newly fertilized eggs. This study demonstrates that later yolk-sac Chinook larvae (before exogenous feeding) are exposed to higher lipid equivalents POP concentrations than predicted by maternal deposition, which could lead to underestimates in the toxicity of critical life stages. © 2012 American Chemical Society.",,9,0,,undefined,

Species exhibiting alternative reproductive tactics (ARTs) are ideal model systems to examine these mechanisms. Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) exhibits two distinct ARTs: hooknoses, which are large males that establish spawning dominance hierarchies via intense male-male competition and jacks, which are smaller precocious sneaking males that steal fertilizations via sperm competition. In this study, we examine plasma testosterone (T), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT) and maturation-inducing steroid (MIS; 17α,20β-dihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one) profiles of spawning hooknoses and jacks. Furthermore, we examine relationships between androgens and primary (gonad mass, gonadosomatic index and sperm traits) and secondary (total mass, body size, hump depth and kype length) sexual characters. Relationships between MIS and sperm traits are also examined. We found that hooknoses and jacks did not significantly differ in terms of plasma T, 11-KT or MIS concentrations. Moreover, we found significant positive relationships between levels of both androgens within each ART. There were no significant relationships between androgens, MIS and sperm traits. T and 11-KT concentrations co-varied positively with gonad investment and kype length in jacks. In hooknoses, 11-KT concentration was positively related to total mass, hump depth and condition factor. Overall, these findings suggest that there are differential androgen effects for each of the ARTs in Chinook salmon. © 2011.",11-Ketotestosterone | Alternative reproductive tactic | Gonad | Hooknose | Jack | Progestin,26,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

Importantly, we show for the first time that enhanced levels of Spy1 protein are found in a large number of human breast cancers and that knockdown of Spy1 impairs breast cancer cell proliferation.Conclusions: Collectively, this work supports that Spy1 is a unique activator of Cdk1 in breast cancer cells and may represent a valuable drug target and/or a prognostic marker for subsets of breast cancers. © 2012 Al Sorkhy et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,9,1,,undefined,

In Drosophila, SAC genes have been found to play a role in ensuring proper chromosome segregation in meiosis, possibly reflecting a similar role for the SAC in APC Fzy inhibition during meiosis. We found that loss of function mutations in SAC genes, Mad2, zwilch, and mps1, do not lead to the predicted rise in APC Fzy-dependent degradation of cyclin B either globally throughout the egg or locally on the meiotic spindle. Further, the SAC is not responsible for the inability of APC Fzy to target cyclin B and promote anaphase in metaphase II arrested eggs from cort mutant females.

Recent studies have revealed that nonoscine vocal behavior is more complex than previously thought, yet we still have a rudimentary understanding of how vocalizations of suboscine and nonpasserine birds are infuenced by genetic and geographic variation. We examined geographic variation in male calls, female calls, and duets of Barred Owls (Strix varia) among 10 locations across the southeastern United States. Recent molecular work revealed two genetically distinct clades of Barred Owl at either end of our transect, with substantial introgression in between. We predicted that calls would vary with genetic distance in a clinal pattern, but that duets and duetting behavior might exhibit dialects similar to that of learned bird song. Discriminant analysis did not reveal any components of vocalizations or vocal behavior that could be used to assign vocalizations to the correct recording location. There were no relationships between any aspect of vocal structure or behavior and geographic distance. Some characteristics of male and female calls and duets varied among locations, but there was no discernible geographic pattern. We suggest that such inconsistent geographic variation in vocalizations is not unexpected for non-song-learning species. The lack of geographic pattern in vocalizations may be due, in part, to high levels of individual variation, recent signal evolution, and local adaptations. We discuss the application of these results to the ontogeny and evolution of complex, coordinated vocal behavior in nonpasserines. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2012.

However, discrepant reports leave doubts about the functional roles of these conserved proteins. In this review, we attempt to resolve some of these seemingly contradictory reports. We discuss how stimulation protocols, sources of calcium (voltage-gated channels versus internal stores), and expression patterns (presynaptic versus postsynaptic) of Frq may result in the activation of various protein targets, leading to different synaptic effects. In addition, the potential interactions of Frq's C-terminal and N-terminal domains with other proteins are discussed. Frq also has a role in regulating neurite outgrowth, axonal regeneration, and synaptic development. We examine whether the effects of Frq on neurotransmitter release and neurite outgrowth are distinct or interrelated through homeostatic mechanisms. Learning and memory are affected by manipulations of Frq probably through changes in synaptic transmission and neurite outgrowth, raising the possibility that Frq may be implicated in human pathological conditions, including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and X-linked mental retardation. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012.",Axon regeneration | Calcium | Calcium-binding protein | Drosophila | Facilitation | Learning | LTP | Memory | Neurite outgrowth | Neurotransmitter release | Postsynaptic | Presynaptic | Short-term synaptic plasticity,25,0,,511978,Mountain Equipment Co-op

We investigated multiple paternity, reproductive skew and correlates of male reproductive success in a wild population of the Trinidadian guppy (Poecilia reticulata). We used nine microsatellite loci to assess the frequency of multiple paternity, number of sires per brood and reproductive skew. Across broods, the frequency of multiple paternity was high with 94% of broods having multiple sires (range: 1-5), resulting in a reproductive skew of 0.14. Variation in male reproductive success was high (range: 0-14 offspring per male), suggesting that there is considerable opportunity for sexual selection. Next, we examined correlations between male reproductive success and sexual coloration, sperm velocity and gonopodium length. Relative area of orange, black, iridescent and total coloration, and sperm velocity were not correlated with reproductive success. However, gonopodium length explained 14% of the variation in reproductive success, suggesting that gonopodium length is likely a sexually selected trait.

Thus, understanding the magnitude and pattern of connections among populations and the temporal variation in these patterns is critical for the effective management and conservation of marine species. Despite recent advances in our understanding of marine connectivity, few empirical studies have directly measured the magnitude or pattern of connections among populations of marine fishes, and none have explicitly investigated temporal variation in demographic connectivity. We use genetic assignment tests to track the dispersal of 456 individual larval fishes to quantify the extent of connectivity, dispersal, self-recruitment and local retention within and among seven populations of a coral reef fish (Stegastes partitus) over a three-year period. We found that some larvae do disperse long distances (~200 km); however, self-recruitment was a regular phenomenon. Importantly, we found that dispersal distances, self-recruitment, local retention and the pattern of connectivity varied significantly among years. Our data highlight the unpredictable nature of connectivity, and underscore the need for more, temporally replicated, empirical measures of connectivity to inform management decisions. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Connectivity matrix | Dispersal kernel | Local retention | Marine protected areas | Metapopulation | Self-recruitment,67,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

The greenside darter (Etheostoma blennioides), until recently a species of special concern, expanded its Canadian range and is now common and widespread in the Grand River watershed (GRW). This is despite there being no evidence of greenside darter in the GRW prior to 1990. The goal of this study was to genetically characterize the GRW greenside darter introduction. Greenside darter were sampled in the GRW, the three known native watersheds in Canada, and one site from Ohio. We measured genetic diversity and population structure, and tested for population bottlenecks using eight microsatellite loci. Genotype assignment was used to identify possible introduction sources. Populations in the GRW showed similar genetic diversity to native watershed populations with no evidence for recent or historical population bottlenecks. Genotype assignment showed that one of the Canadian watersheds and the Ohio site were not potential sources of the GRW greenside darter, whereas the Thames River watershed was the most likely source. Substantial population genetic structure exists among the sample sites in the GRW. Clearly, the current widespread and abundant distribution of the greenside darter in the GRW is not the result of recent expansion of an existing native population, but rather multiple introductions into at least three sites in the GRW, followed by rapid population growth. Although the GRW E. blennioides is introduced, it harbours considerable genetic diversity and represents an important northern range extension for this species. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Genetic bottleneck | Genetic diversity | Genotype assignment | Microsatellite markers | Range expansion | Species introduction,8,0,,undefined,Fisheries and Oceans Canada

Rainbow trout dominate at low elevations (<1250m) in the river mainstem, cutthroat in high-elevation tributaries (>1400m), and hybrids are numerically dominant in the mid-elevation range. We hypothesized that metabolism of rainbow trout would exceed that of cutthroat trout, and that the elevation gradient in genetic makeup would be mirrored by a gradient in metabolic traits, with intermediate traits in the hybrid-dominated ecotone. Metabolic traits were measured and regressed against the genetic makeup of individuals and elevation. Rainbow trout had higher oxygen consumption rates (OCRs), higher white muscle lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and citrate synthase (CS) activity, and higher plasma acetylcholinesterase (AchE) than cutthroat trout. Hybrids had intermediate OCRs and AchE, but LDH activity as high as rainbow trout. While hybrid zones are usually modelled as a balance between cross species mating and selection against hybrids, ecotonal hybrid zones, where hybrids proliferate in intermediate habitats and have traits that appear well suited to ecotonal conditions, have been proposed for some plants and animals, and may have important implications for resource management and conservation. © 2011 The Linnean Society of London.",Acetylcholinesterase | Citrate synthase | Ecotone | Elevation | Hybrid zone | Introgression | Lactate dehydrogenase | Oxygen consumption,26,1,,undefined,

Because true omnivores must distribute adaptive feeding decisions among two disparate tissue types, understanding the context that plants provide for foraging is important to understand their role in food webs. We varied prey and plant resources to investigate the plant context in an omnivorous true bug, Dicyphus hesperus. The contribution of plant species to fitness was unimportant in water acquisition decisions, but affected numbers of prey consumed over longer periods. In plant communities, in the absence of prey, D. hesperus moved to plants with the highest resource quality. Unlike pure predators facing declining prey, omnivores can use a nondepleting resource to fund future foraging without paying a significant cost. However, the dual resource exploitation can also impose significant constraints when both types of resources are essential. The presence of relatively profitable plants that are spatially separate from intermediate consumer populations could provide a mechanism to promote stability within food webs with plant-feeding omnivores.

Bioaccumulation is a complex, multifaceted process, which calls for accurate error analysis. Yet, attempts to quantify and compare propagation of error in bioaccumulation metrics across species and chemicals are rare. Here, we quantitatively assessed the combined influence of physicochemical, physiological, ecological, and environmental parameters known to affect bioaccumulation for 4 species and 2 chemicals, to assess whether uncertainty in these factors can explain the observed differences among laboratory and field studies. The organisms evaluated in simulations including mayfly larvae, depositfeeding polychaetes, yellow perch, and little owl represented a range of ecological conditions and biotransformation capacity. The chemicals, pyrene and the polychlorinated biphenyl congener PCB-153, represented medium and highly hydrophobic chemicals with different susceptibilities to biotransformation. An existing state of the art probabilistic bioaccumulation model was improved by accounting for bioavailability and absorption efficiency limitations, due to the presence of black carbon in sediment, and was used for probabilistic modeling of variability and propagation of error. Results showed that at lower trophic levels (mayfly and polychaete), variability in bioaccumulation was mainly driven by sediment exposure, sediment composition and chemical partitioning to sediment components, which was in turn dominated by the influence of black carbon. At higher trophic levels (yellow perch and the little owl), food web structure (i.e., diet composition and abundance) and chemical concentration in the diet became more important particularly for the most persistent compound, PCB-153. These results suggest that variation in bioaccumulation assessment is reduced most by improved identification of food sources as well as by accounting for the chemical bioavailability in food components. Improvements in the accuracy of aqueous exposure appear to be less relevant when applied to moderate to highly hydrophobic compounds, because this route contributes only marginally to total uptake. The determination of chemical bioavailability and the increase in understanding and qualifying the role of sediment components (black carbon, labile organic matter, and the like) on chemical absorption efficiencies has been identified as a key next steps. © 2011 SETAC.",Bioaccumulation | Field | Guideline | Laboratory | Model,43,0,,undefined,

We also reviewed the scientific literature to compare the number of species transported by ships to those reported in nature. Here, we show that even though ships transport nearly entire local communities, a strong relationship between propagule and colonization pressure exists only for dinoflagellates. Our study provides evidence that colonization pressure of invertebrates and diatoms may fluctuate widely irrespective of propagule pressure. We suggest that the lack of correspondence is explained by reduced uptake of invertebrates into the transport vector and the sensitivity of invertebrates and diatoms to selective pressures during transportation. Selection during transportation is initially evident through decreases in propagule pressure, followed by decreased colonization pressure in the most sensitive taxa. © 2012 The Royal Society.",Ballast sediment | Ballast water | Diatoms | Dinoflagellates | Invertebrates | Selective pressure,36,1,,undefined,

Hydrogen (H 2) is a promising potential energy carrier for meeting future energy needs because it is eco-friendly, it has a high heating value (2.75 times higher energy content than hydrocarbon fuels) and it can be converted into electricity via fuel cells (Benemann, 1996; Momirlan and Vezrioglu, 2002). Currently, H 2 is mainly produced from fossil fuel-based feedstock (Oil/naptha reforming, coal gasfication, methane steam reforming etc.,) chemicals because many commercial petrochemical processes are cost effective (Ewan and Allen, 2005). However, the dark fermentation process is emerging as a practical route for producing H2 because of fast reaction rates, technical simplicity and less area (1-5%) requirements compared to the direct photolysis or indirect photolysis or photo fermentation (Levin et al., 2004; Li and Fang 2007). The successful operation of the dark fermentation process requires a good understanding of how mixed microbial cultures behave under a variety of operating conditions. Identifying microbial communities can provide descriptions of the interaction between different groups; however, this approach may not provide sufficient information about the function of the communities. Noticeable changes in the microbial community composition within the H 2 fermenting reactor is expected during operation. Quantifying the gene expression and monitoring fluctuations within the community structure will provide an understanding of the changes linked to the operation of bioreactors. This approach can possibly serve as a rapid tool for bioprocess monitoring. In the present study, genes responsible for H 2 production and H 2 consumption were monitored as a means of establishing changes within the microbial community structure. The Fe-Fe hydrogenase gene is monitored because it is related to H 2 production. Methanogens and acetogens are major H 2 consumers and monitoring includes examination of the McrA gene and formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase (FTHFS) gene, respectively. A monitoring protocol for three different sources of cultures (A, B and C) at pH 5.5 and 37°C was developed using qRT-PCR. Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis was also performed to characterize changes in the community. The results indicated that the expression levels of [Fe-Fe]-hydrogenase, MrcA and FTHFS gene varied with the culture source.

For community dynamics, predator-specific size-based variation in diet, trophic position, and habitat use are rarely accounted for. Using two applied tools (stable isotopes and stomach content data), we examined inter- and intra-species ontogenetic variability in diet (stomach contents), trophic position (TP SIA for δ 15 N and TP SCA for stomach contents), and habitat use (δ 13 C) of two large sharks, the scalloped hammerhead (Sphyrna lewini) and the dusky (Carcharhinus obscurus). Stomach contents identified size-based and gender-specific shifts in diet indicating resource partitioning for and between species. Calculated TP for the two sharks varied by method, either TP SIA or TP SCA and with species, size, and gender, but were complicated by differing baselines and broad functional prey groups, respectively. TP increased with size for S. lewini, but was low in large C. obscurus compared with small sharks. Size-based δ 13 C profiles indicated habitat partitioning by sex in S. lewini and a movement to shelf edge foraging in large C. obscurus.

Gravity models provide one of the most useful techniques available to model dispersal of nonindigenous invasive species (NIS) across heterogeneous landscapes, as these models are able to capture transport patterns of recreational boaters who are dominant vectors responsible for aquatic NIS dispersal. Despite the widespread use of gravity models in forecasting biological invasions, different classes of gravity models have not been evaluated regarding their comparative ability to capture recreational transport patterns and subsequent use in predicting NIS establishment. Here we evaluate model selection between unconstrained, total-flow-constrained, production-constrained and doubly-constrained stochastic gravity models to assess dispersal of the spiny waterflea Bythotrephes between Ontario lakes. Differences between the models relate to the amount of data required and constraints under which calculations of source/destination interactions are made. For each class of gravity model, we then estimated the probability of a lake having established Bythotrephes populations by modeling the relationship between empirical presence/absence data and inbound recreational traffic (i. e. propagule pressure) via boosted regression. The unconstrained gravity model provided the best fit to observed traffic patterns of recreational boaters. However, when output from the gravity models was used to predict Bythotrephes establishment, the doubly-constrained gravity model provided the strongest relationship between inbound recreational traffic and observed Bythotrephes presence/absence, followed by the production-constrained model. Our results indicate production-constrained gravity models offer an acceptable balance between modeling recreational boater traffic and their utility to estimate establishment probabilities. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Biological invasion | Invasive species | Nonindigenous species | Stochastic gravity model,13,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Hypotheses about the evolution of song repertoires differ as to whether selection acts primarily on repertoire size itself or the ability to match songs of neighbours. We used a 16-channel acoustic location system to record neighbourhoods of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia melodia) during the dawn chorus. We asked whether males sing all songs with similar frequency as predicted by the Repertoire Size Hypothesis, whether males preferentially sing highly shared songs as predicted by the General Sharing Hypothesis, or whether use of highly shared songs is associated with phenotype as predicted by the Conditional Sharing Hypothesis. Contrary to the Repertoire Size Hypothesis, most males did not sing all songs equally often. Contrary to the General Sharing Hypothesis, we found no general tendency to overproduce highly shared songs. The degree to which males overproduced highly shared songs was repeatable across days, indicating consistent individual differences, and varied across neighbourhoods. Moreover, and consistent with the Conditional Sharing Hypothesis, older males were more likely to overproduce highly shared songs. If highly shared song is a conventional signal of aggression, with the threat of receiver retaliation maintaining honesty, older males may be more willing or able to risk conflict. Alternatively, males may learn which songs are effective signals for an area. Finally, age-related variation in vocal performance may shape the adaptive value of highly shared song. © 2011 Springer-Verlag.",Conditional sharing hypothesis | Conventional signals | General sharing hypothesis | Repertoire size hypothesis | Song repertoires | Song sharing,13,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

In response to noise masking, signallers can potentially improve acoustic signal transmission by adjusting the timing, frequency or amplitude of their signals. These changes can be a short-term modification in response to transient noise or a long-term modification in response to chronic noise. An animal's ability to adapt to anthropogenic noise can be crucial to its success. In this study, we evaluated the effects of anthropogenic noise on the structure of red-winged blackbird song. First, we manipulated the presence of anthropogenic noise by experimentally broadcasting either silence or low-frequency white noise to subjects inhabiting quiet marshes located away from roadsides. Subjects exhibited increased signal tonality when temporarily exposed to low-frequency white noise, suggesting that red-winged blackbirds can alter their signals rapidly in response to sudden noise. Second, we compared songs produced in quiet marshes located away from roadsides with songs produced during quiet periods at roadside marshes that are normally noisy. This allowed us to test whether birds that are exposed to chronic anthropogenic noise exhibit altered song structure during temporarily quiet periods. Subjects residing in roadside marshes that are normally polluted with anthropogenic noise sang songs with increased tonality during quiet periods. Overall, our results show that anthropogenic noise influences the structure of birdsong. These effects should be considered in conservation and wildlife management. © 2011.

Shark fin provides a novel, minor invasive source material, which is important considering the conservation status of many large sharks. Fin, however, is not a single tissue but composed of multiple tissues, primarily skin and cartilage. This may complicate the interpretation of SI, as fin can be sampled from multiple fins and different regions of a fin from an individual. Here, we examined the variation in δ 15N and δ 13C with sample location on the anal fin of Caribbean reef sharks (Carcharhinus perezi). Values of δ 15N and δ 13C were highly correlated across sampling locations indicating that mean population or size class fin SI data would be reliable. At the individual level, large variation in δ 15N and δ 13C between anal fin sampling locations indicates that the varying proportional contributions of tissues would complicate individual level analyses. For three pelagic shark species, dorsal fin δ 13C values were consistently higher than δ 13C muscle tissue values, identifying tissue-specific diet discrimination factors. This would confound multiple tissue studies that assume that SI values across tissues will be equal if the animal is in equilibrium with its diet. Proposed sampling protocols for fin material will negate many of these issues, but caution is warranted for comparisons of SI data between shark fin and other tissues or across species until the isotope dynamics of fin have been experimentally validated. © 2011, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,13,0,,undefined,

Most studies of species-flocks, however, focus only on a single group of organisms, and few have attempted to integrate geological, limnological, ecological, and genetic drivers of speciation on multiple species-flocks at various trophic levels. As such, there is a need for a comprehensive model system for research on speciation in aquatic environments where multiple radiations are investigated at various levels of biological organization (e.g., individual, population, and ecosystem) and placed in light of geographical and geological setting. The ancient Malili Lakes of Sulawesi, Indonesia, are ideal candidates for such a model, and represent the only hydrologically connected ancient lakes in the world. These lakes are characterized by ultra-oligotrophy and unique physicochemical conditions that govern the composition and production of planktonic communities. At higher trophic levels, there are three recurring trends: (1) low taxonomic richness and simple community structures, (2) adaptive radiations with trophic specialization, and (3) remarkably high endemism with evolutionary innovations throughout the lakes and species-flocks. Furthermore, the restricted geographic distributions of species-flocks within the Malili Lakes indicate that each lake constitutes a unique environment, and dispersal among lakes is limited, despite close contemporary connectivity. These observations suggest that ecological and evolutionary processes are regulated from the bottom up, and speciation is primarily facilitated by interspecific and intraspecific competition for limited resources. The Malili Lakes represent an outstanding natural model for integrative research into speciation as they offer the opportunity to explore the roles of geography, dispersal, and selection in the radiation of aquatic organisms. © 2011 The Author.",,27,1,,undefined,Mountain Equipment Co-op

However, there has been little recognition of the spatial and temporal variabilities of these isotopes within habitats of aquatic ecosystems. To address this, δ13C and δ15N were measured in seston, zebra mussels (Dreissena polymorpha) and young-of-year (YOY) yellow (Perca flavescens), and white perch (Morone americana) collected from four sites across the offshore habitat of the western basin of Lake Erie during June-September 2009. Values of δ13C and δ15N showed significant spatial and temporal variations, with month accounting for >50% of the variation, for both stable isotopes and all the species except seston. Such variation in isotope values has the potential to significantly influence or confound interpretation of stable isotopes in measures, such as trophic position (TP) which use lower trophic level organisms as their baseline. For example, TP was found to vary up to 0.7 for yellow and white perch (TP = δ15Nfish - δ15Nzebra mussel/diet-tissue fractionation factor) depending on the zebra mussel data used (e.g., from a different location or a different collection month).

Here we use data on breeding bird, diatom, fish, invertebrate, and wetland plant communities to develop robust indicators of ecological condition of the U.S. Lake Superior coastal zone. Sites were selected as part of a larger, stratified random design for the entire U.S. Great Lakes coastal region, covering gradients of anthropogenic stress defined by over 200 stressor variables (e.g. agriculture, altered land cover, human populations, and point source pollution). A total of 89 locations in Lake Superior were sampled between 2001 and 2004 including 31 sites for stable isotope analysis of benthic macroinvertebrates, 62 sites for birds, 35 for diatoms, 32 for fish and macroinvertebrates, and 26 for wetland vegetation. A relationship between watershed disturbance metrics and 15N levels in coastal macroinvertebrates confirmed that watershed-based stressor gradients are expressed across Lake Superior's coastal ecosystems, increasing confidence in ascribing causes of biological responses to some landscape activities. Several landscape metrics in particular-agriculture, urbanization, human population density, and road density-strongly influenced the responses of indicator species assemblages. Conditions were generally good in Lake Superior, but in some areas watershed stressors produced degraded conditions that were similar to those in the southern and eastern U.S. Great Lakes. The following indicators were developed based on biotic responses to stress in Lake Superior in the context of all the Great Lakes: (1) an index of ecological condition for breeding bird communities, (2) diatom-based nutrient and solids indicators, (3) fish and macroinvertebrate indicators for coastal wetlands, and (4) a non-metric multidimensional scaling for wetland plants corresponding to a cumulative stress index. These biotic measures serve as useful indicators of the ecological condition of the Lake Superior coast; collectively, they provide a baseline assessment of selected biological conditions for the U.S. Lake Superior coastal region and prescribe a means to detect change over time. © 2011 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",birds | diatoms | fish | indicators | macroinvertebrates | plants,10,0,,EPA/R-82867501,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

The syndrome is initiated by a mutation in one of two tumor suppressor genes, TSC1 or TSC2 which encode for the proteins hamartin and tuberin, respectively. Herein we demonstrate that tuberin binds and regulates the G2/M cyclin, cyclin B1. We have determined that this binding region encompasses a mutational hotspot within tuberin implicated in some of the most severe cases of TS. Mimicking a mutation found in a subset of patients with tuberous sclerosis we found a significant reduction in the binding between tuberin and cyclin B1. Functionally, our data supports that tuberin plays a role in regulating the cellular localization of cyclin B1.

Despite this, we know little about intraspecific variance in male genital morphology, or how male and female reproductive traits covary among divergent populations. Here we address both topics using natural populations of the guppy, Poecilia reticulata, a livebearing fish that exhibits divergent patterns of male sexual behaviour among populations. Initially, we performed a series of mating trials on a single population to examine the relationship between the morphology of the male's copulatory organ (the gonopodium) and the success of forced matings. Using a combination of linear measurements and geometric morphometrics, we found that variation in the length and shape of the gonopodium predicted the success of forced matings in terms of the rate of genital contacts and insemination success, respectively. We then looked for geographical divergence in these traits, since the relative frequency of forced matings tends to be greater in high-predation populations. We found consistent patterns of variation in male genital size and shape in relation to the level of predation, and corresponding patterns of (co)variation in female genital morphology. Together, these data enable us to draw tentative conclusions about the underlying selective pressures causing correlated patterns of divergence in male and female genital traits, which point to a role for sexually antagonistic selection. ©2011 The Royal Society.",Coevolution | Genitalia | Sexual conflict | Sexual selection,54,1,,undefined,

However, the relationship between body size and the frequency of distress calls has been examined in only one study of temperate birds. We examined size-frequency relationships in the distress calls and songs of a Neotropical bird community in northwestern Costa Rica. In 2008 and 2009, we recorded distress calls and determined the body mass of 54 mist-netted birds representing 38 species, 35 genera, and 14 families. We obtained songs for these same species from sound libraries and commercially available compact discs. For each vocalization, we measured minimum frequency and frequency of maximum amplitude. Larger birds produced lower-frequency distress calls and songs than smaller birds. Phylogenetically controlled analyses revealed that the frequency of maximum amplitude was negatively correlated with body mass for both distress calls and songs. Minimum frequency was negatively correlated with mass for distress calls, but not songs. Our analyses suggest that the influence of phylogeny on the relationship between frequency characteristics and body size is modest. Pair-wise comparisons across 37 species revealed that distress calls and songs had similar minimum frequencies, but songs had significantly lower frequencies of maximum amplitude than distress calls. This difference may arise from differences in signal function. Lower-frequency sounds should transmit farther through forest habitats and songs must often transmit longer distances to reach their intended audience than distress calls. Our results support the general theory that body size is negatively correlated with the frequency of acoustic signals by demonstrating that this pattern holds true for both distress calls and songs in a Neotropical bird community. © 2011 The Authors.

We describe the vocal behavior of Great Curassows (Crax rubra), a little-studied Cracid species currently listed as vulnerable. From 2008 to 2010, we recorded curassows in northwest Costa Rica using both handheld and automated digital recorders. Analysis of recordings revealed that Great Curassows had a vocal repertoire of five call types. Yip and bark calls are sex-specific alarm calls of short duration (0.12 and 0.08 s, respectively). The descending whistle is a longer duration alarm call (2.18 s) produced primarily by males. The snarl is a short call (0.67 s) associated with a threat display produced by adults with dependent young. The boom call was the most common Great Curassow vocalization, and was given only by males. Boom calls are long (8.86 s), low-frequency (<150 Hz), multisyllable calls comprised of four stereotyped phrases. Great Curassows often uttered boom calls well before dawn, with a peak in activity at dawn and the hours following. Males produced bouts of repeated boom calls that lasted an average of 35 min, but sometimes continued for more than 5 h. Boom calls were given from February to June, with a peak in late April and early May when breeding begins. Discriminant analysis of boom calls of birds from 10 different locations revealed interindividual variation in call structure that may be useful for bioacoustic monitoring of individuals. Our results suggest that automated recorders might provide a way to monitor the abundance of male curassows because their boom calls are given frequently during the period from February to June and can be detected at distances up to 250 m. © 2011 The Authors.

Mayflies bioaccumulate sediment-associated contaminants by bioconcentration and biomagnification during the aquatic stage and concentrate POP residues postemergence due to bioamplification, which occurs as a result of weight and lipid loss without contaminant loss. The present study quantified polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) bioamplification in male and female emergent mayflies at three sites. Male mayflies used 36 to 68% of their lipids during emergence, with the exception of caged males that were prevented from flight. Females did not lose lipid content between pre-emergent nymph and emerged life stages. Mass balance indicated no PCB elimination between life stages. The mean PCB bioamplification factor, expressed as the ratio of lipid-equivalent PCB concentrations across life stages, was 2.05±0.38 for male imagos/nymphs and 1.91±0.18 for male imago/subimago life stages. For females, bioamplification factors were close to unity. Wildlife consumers of imago stages of emergent mayflies can potentially increase their total daily intake of PCBs by 36% depending on the sex-ratio composition of their diet relative to animals that feed predominantly on nymph or subimago stages during mass emergence events. © 2011 SETAC.",Bioaccumulation | Biota-sediment accumulation factor | Hexagenia | Persistent organic pollutants | Trophic transfer,28,0,,undefined,

We sampled 135 ships arriving to three different regions of Canada to assess abundance and species richness of invertebrates and their dormant eggs transported in ballast sediments. By sampling ships that followed particular pathways, we were able to compare vector strength to different regions, the invasion risk of transoceanic vs. coastal vessels, and the effect of midocean exchange, length of voyage, and amount of sediment on the richness and abundance of species inside ballast tanks. Although standardized ballast management regulations have been implemented across Canada, the resulting invasion risk is not uniform across regions. Ships arriving to the Atlantic region carried a greater sediment load with correspondingly higher abundance and species richness than those arriving to the Pacific and Great Lakes regions. Abundance and species richness of invertebrates and their dormant eggs associated with transoceanic ships did not differ from that of ships operating along coastal areas of North America. Similarly, midocean exchange did not reduce either abundance or species richness of invertebrate dormant eggs in ships. Finally, the length of voyage did not influence taxonomic composition or abundance of invertebrate dormant eggs but was directly related to survival of active macroinvertebrates. Ballast sediments could introduce new NIS to some regions of Canada despite requirements to manage ships' ballast by midocean exchange.

In three urban, fish-bearing waterways of British Columbia, Canada, we found the active ingredients of WeedEx®, KillEx®, and Roundup® herbicide formulations (2,4-D, dicamba, glyphosate, and mecoprop) at low to high ng/L concentrations (0.26 to 309ng/L) in routine conditions, i.e., no rain for at least one week. Following rain, these concentrations increased by an average of eightfold, suggesting runoff as a major route of herbicide introduction in these waterways. To determine whether fish might be able to limit point-source exposures through sensory-driven behaviors, we introduced pulses of representative herbicide mixtures to individual adult zebrafish (a model species) in flow-through tanks. Fish did the opposite of limit exposure; they chose to spend more time in pulses of herbicide mixtures representative of those that may occur with rain events. This attraction response was not altered by a previous 4-d exposure to lower concentrations of the mixtures, suggesting fish will not learn from previous exposures. However, previous exposures did alter an attraction response to an amino acid prevalent in food (L-alanine). The present study demonstrates that fish living within urban waterways may elect to place themselves in herbicide-contaminated environments and that these exposures may alter their behavioral responses to cues necessary for survival. © 2011 SETAC.","2,4-D | Behavioral attraction | Glyphosate | Herbicide avoidance | Zebrafish",20,0,,undefined,

The first step of our statistical analysis was based on simple exponential decay models parameterized with Bayesian inference techniques to assess the declining rates in four intensively sampled fish species, i.e., walleye (Stizostedion vitreum), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and white bass (Morone chrysops). Because the exponential model postulates monotonic decrease of the PCB levels, we included first- or second-order random error terms in our statistical formulations to accommodate non-monotonic patterns in the dataset studied. Generally, our results suggest that the PCBs have been decreasing over the last 30. years with relatively weak rates that vary among the different fish species examined. Yet, our analysis with the exponential decay model also identified an increasing trend in the PCB concentrations of walleye skinless-boneless filet data, which is manifested after the mid-90s. In the second step, we used dynamic linear modeling (DLM) analysis to account for the fact that the fish length covaries with the PCB concentrations and that different sized fish may have been sampled over time. Our DLM analysis suggests that the previously reported trend of the walleye filet data is actually an artifact associated with the bias of the fish sampling practices followed. The coho salmon and rainbow trout PCB concentrations have been decreasing steadily during the study period but the associated rates were relatively weak. Finally, the PCB trends in white bass appear to have been stabilized over that last decade, although the robustness of this result remains to be confirmed due to the temporal inconsistencies of the information used. We conclude by emphasizing the importance of explicitly accounting for the different covariates (e.g., length, age, lipid content) that can potentially hamper the detection of the actual temporal trends of fish contaminants. © 2011 International Association for Great Lakes Research.",Bayesian inference | Bioaccumulation | Dynamic linear modeling | Fish contamination | Lake Erie | Polychlorinated biphenyls,22,0,,89002,

G. nigrifrons appears to have a complex ecology therefore further transmission trials are required to verify its phytoplasma vector role in fruit trees.",Ecology | Graminella nigrifrons | Phytoplasma | Phytoplasma vector,1,0,,undefined,

To better understand the functional significance of intra-specific variation in egg size as a determinant of offspring fitness within a life-history (sex-specific life-history strategies) and an environmental (poor rearing conditions) context, we experimentally increased developmental stress (via maternal feather-clipping) in the sexually size-dimorphic European starling (Sturnus vulgaris) and measured phenotypic traits in offspring across multiple biological scales. As predicted by life-history theory, sons and daughters had different responses when faced with developmental stress and variation in egg size. In response to developmental stress, small egg size in normally faster-growing sons was associated with catch-up growth prior to attaining larger adult size, resulting in a reduction in developmental stability. Daughters apparently avoided this developmental instability by reducing growth rate and eventual adult body mass and size. Interestingly, large egg size provided offspring with greater developmental flexibility under poor growth conditions. Large-egg sons and daughters avoided the reduction in developmental stability, and daughters also showed enhanced escape performance during flight trials. Furthermore, large egg size resulted in elevated immune responses for both sexes under developmental stress. These findings show that there can be significant, but complex, context-specific effects of egg size on offspring phenotype at least up to fledging, but these can only be demonstrated by appreciating variation in the quality of the offspring environment and life histories. Results are therefore consistent with egg size playing a significant role in shaping the phenotypic outcome of offspring in species that show even greater intra-specific variation in egg size than starlings. © 2011 The Authors.

First, signalers can repeat their signals, encoding information into sequence-level parameters, such as signaling rate. Second, signalers can encode information into the fine structural variation of individual signals. This mechanism requires sophisticated encoding and decoding but potentially affords more rapid or efficient information transfer. The chick-a-dee call of Parid birds is a structurally complex signal that conveys food-and predator-related information to both conspecific and heterospecific receivers. However, the basic mechanism by which it communicates information is unclear. Previous research suggests that variation in the number of terminal notes is important, but this structural trait has not been manipulated independently from other structural traits or from sequence-level parameters, such as total duty cycle. We independently manipulated the fine structure and duty cycle of the calls of Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) and then broadcast them to potential receivers. Both conspecific and heterospecific receivers ignored manipulations to the fine structure of individual calls when the duty cycle of the signaling sequences was held constant. In marked contrast, receivers exhibited significantly stronger responses when the duty cycle was experimentally increased, and the fine structure of individual calls was held constant. Specifically, signaling sequences with a high duty cycle attracted more conspecific and heterospecific receivers and caused those receivers to approach the speaker more quickly, to approach the speaker more closely, and to remain within 10 m of the speaker for longer. These findings show that receivers respond to a simple sequence-level trait in a structurally complex avian signal. © 2011 The Author.",alarm signal | animal communication | chickadee | information encoding | signal,22,1,,undefined,British Ornithologists’ Union

Because migration can be one of the most stressful periods of an animal's annual cycle, developing colourful plumage may be particularly challenging for species in which migration and moult periods overlap or occur sequentially. The purpose of this study was to investigate pigmentary and condition-dependent bases of carotenoid colour variation in a small migratory passerine, the golden-crowned kinglet Regulus satrapa (Family Regulidae). We captured 186 male and female kinglets of various ages during fall migration in southwestern Ontario, Canada and recorded arrival date, body condition index, fat and pectoral muscle scores, wing mite infestation, and feather growth rate as measures of condition. We quantified crown coloration using reflectance spectrometry and analyzed feather carotenoids using high-performance liquid chromatography. Yellow crown feathers of female kinglets contained only yellow hydroxycarotenoids, whereas orange feathers of males harboured a suite of eight carotenoid pigments. Males with longer wavelength orange crown hues deposited greater concentrations of ketocarotenoids, especially canthaxanthin. Female kinglets with longer wavelength crown hues and males with longer wavelength crown hues and more saturated crown coloration left for migration earlier in the year. Females with longer wavelength crown hues had fewer feather mites and tended to be in better condition. However, male kinglets with more saturated coloration possessed smaller pectoral muscles. This is the first study to identify plumage carotenoids in this North American bird family and to determine the pigmentary basis for both inter- and intrasexual colour variation. Our results provide further support for the condition-dependence of carotenoid coloration and suggest that ornamental elaboration in both sexes may encode information about fall condition and migratory performance. © 2011 The Authors.",,5,0,,undefined,

We explore the survival of invertebrate dormant eggs in collected ships' ballast sediment over a 1-year period to determine relative invasion potential across taxa (i.e. rotifers, copepods, cladocerans and bryozoans) and different habitats (freshwater, marine). Location Canadian Atlantic and Pacific coasts and Laurentian Great Lakes. Methods During 2007 and 2008, 19 ballast samples were collected as a part of a larger study. The degradation rate of dormant eggs was assessed by enumerating dormant eggs and by conducting viability hatching experiments. Results Taxa examined included rotifers, copepods, anomopods, onychopods and bryozoans. Dormant eggs of rotifers degraded at the highest rate of all taxa examined, with no viable eggs remaining within 10months. Copepods showed a less rapid degradation rate than rotifers. The degradation rate of anomopod dormant eggs was significantly slower than that of both rotifers and copepods. Onychopods and bryozoans did not visibly degrade at all over 12months. Viability hatching experiments were successful for rotifers, copepods, and anomopods. Onychopods and bryozoans did not hatch during any of the three hatching trials. Main conclusions Dormancy is not equally beneficial to all invertebrate taxa. Our results indicate that dormant eggs of rotifers and copepods degrade at a rapid rate and may not pose high invasion risk. In contrast, the slow degradation rate of anomopod dormant eggs and the lack of degradation of onychopod and bryozoan dormant eggs could result in high invasion risk because of their accumulation in ballast tanks. Species having resistant dormant eggs mostly belong to freshwater taxa making freshwater habitats at higher invasion risk by dormant invertebrates than marine habitats. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Ballast sediment | Biological invasions | Degradation rate | Habitat | Invasion potential | Invertebrate dormant eggs,15,0,,undefined,

In response, governments have invested millions of dollars into artificial breeding programs, but many programs have failed to rehabilitate dwindling wild stocks. This failure may in part lie in the lack of knowledge about the genetic architecture of fitness: the genes and genotypes that are associated with individual performance. In this paper we discuss (i) artificial breeding programs, (ii) the genetic architecture of fitness, (iii) additive and nonadditive genetic effects on fitness, (iv) genetic diversity and evolvability, and (v) natural breeding and adaptation. We argue that most breeding programs do not maintain genetic adaptations and may consequently be ineffective at rehabilitating or enhancing wild populations. Moreover, there is no evidence that preserving genetic diversity as measured from neutral genetic markers increases fish performance or population viability outside of populations that experience strong inbreeding depression, and limited data that genetic diversity increases the potential for populations to adapt to changing environments. We suggest that artificial breeding programs should be used only as a last resort when populations face imminent extirpation and that such programs must shift the focus from solely preserving genetic diversity to preserving genetic adaptations.",,41,0,,undefined,

We tested this idea using a condition-dependent individual optimization model (Ardea68, 1980, 225 and The American Naturalist143, 1994, 698) in common eider ducks through descriptive data, path analyses and experimental manipulation. Our results support the causal pathways drawn from the optimization model indicating that individuals adjust their reproductive decisions as a function of their arrival date and body condition at arrival. Independent of body condition, early-arriving females had a longer pre-laying period, but still initiated their nests earlier, and produced larger clutches than late-arriving birds. Independent of arrival date, females in good condition laid earlier than those in poor condition. Manipulation of pre-laying female body condition confirmed that the relationship between condition and laying date was causal. Female common eiders appear to optimize reproductive decisions in response to both their external (i.e. environmental conditions affecting the egg-value) and internal (i.e. body condition) states. These adjustments seem to minimize the fitness costs of reproduction, in which higher clutch size is not associated with an apparent lower survival or future breeding probability. Our study emphasizes the importance of (i) simultaneously considering the timing of migration, the state of individuals and the seasonal change in egg-value to understand clearly birds' breeding decisions and (ii) appreciating the potential proximate and ultimate factors explaining why some individuals delay breeding and/or produce small clutches. © 2010 The Authors.

Invertebrate species are frequently carried in ballast water and sediment,although identification of diapausing eggs can be extremely problematic.Here we test the application of DNA barcoding using mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I and 16S rDNA to identify species from diapausing eggs collected in ballast sediment of ships. The accuracy of DNA barcoding identification was tested by comparing results from the molecular markers against each other, and by comparing barcoding results to traditional morphological identification of individuals hatched from diapausing eggs.Further, we explored two public genetic databases to determine the broader applicability of DNA barcodes. Of 289 diapausing eggs surveyed, sufficient DNA for barcoding was obtained from 96 individuals (33%). Unsuccessful DNA extractions from 67% of eggs in our study were most likely due to degraded condition of eggs.Of 96 eggs with successful DNA extraction, 61 (64%) were identified to species level, while 36% were identified to possible family/order level. Species level identifications were always consistent between methodologies. DNA barcoding was suitable for a wide range of taxa, including Branchiopoda, Copepoda, Rotifera, Bryozoa and Ascidia.Branchiopoda and Copepoda were respectively the best and worst represented groups in genetic databases.Though genetic databases remain incomplete, DNA barcoding resolved nearly double the number of species identified by traditional taxonomy (19 vs.10).Notorious invaders are well represented in existing databases, rendering these NIS detectable using molecular methods.DNA barcoding provides a rapid and accurate approach to identification of invertebrate diapausing eggs that otherwise would be very difficult to identify. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V.2010.",Diapausing eggs | DNA barcodes | Invertebrates | Nonindigenous species | Ship ballast sediment | Species identification,58,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Critical to the interpretation of these data is the assessment of steady state for bioaccumulated residues needed to generate biota sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) and to address control correction of day 0 contaminant residues measured in bioassay organisms. This study applied a novel performance reference compound approach with a pulse-chase experimental design to investigate elimination of a series of isotopically labeled polychlorinated biphenyl (13C-PCBs) in the polychaete worm Nereis virens while simultaneously evaluating native PCB bioaccumulation from field-collected sediments. Results demonstrated that all 13C-PCBs, with the exception of 13C-PCB209 (>80%), were eliminated by more than 90% after 28 d. The three sediment types yielded similar 13C-PCB whole-body elimination rate constants (ktot) producing the following predictive equation: log ktot=-0.09×log KOW-0.45. The rapid loss of 13C-PCBs from worms over the bioassay period indicated that control correction, by subtracting day 0 residues, would result in underestimates of bioavailable sediment residues. Significant uptake of native PCBs was observed only in the most contaminated sediment and proceeded according to kinetic model predictions with steady-state BSAFs ranging from 1 to 3 and peaking for congeners of log KOW between 6.2 and 6.5. The performance reference compound approach can provide novel information about chemical toxicokinetics and also serve as a quality check for the physiological performance of the bioassay organism during standardized bioaccumulation testing. © 2011 SETAC.",Biota sediment accumulation factor | Nereis virens | Polychlorinated biphenyl | Pulse-chase | Sediment,2,0,,undefined,

Animals produce sounds for diverse biological functions such as defending territories, attracting mates, deterring predators, navigation, finding food and maintaining contact with members of their social group. Biologists can take advantage of these acoustic behaviours to gain valuable insights into the spatial and temporal scales over which individuals and populations interact. Advances in bioacoustic technology, including the development of autonomous cabled and wireless recording arrays, permit data collection at multiple locations over time. These systems are transforming the way we study individuals and populations of animals and are leading to significant advances in our understandings of the complex interactions between animals and their habitats. 2. Here, we review questions that can be addressed using bioacoustic approaches, by providing a primer on technologies and approaches used to study animals at multiple organizational levels by ecologists, behaviourists and conservation biologists. 3. Spatially dispersed groups of microphones (arrays) enable users to study signal directionality on a small scale or to locate animals and track their movements on a larger scale. 4. Advances in algorithm development can allow users to discriminate among species, sexes, age groups and individuals. 5. With such technology, users can remotely and non-invasively survey populations, describe the soundscape, quantify anthropogenic noise, study species interactions, gain new insights into the social dynamics of sound-producing animals and track the effects of factors such as climate change and habitat fragmentation on phenology and biodiversity. 6. There remain many challenges in the use of acoustic monitoring, including the difficulties in performing signal recognition across taxa. The bioacoustics community should focus on developing a common framework for signal recognition that allows for various species' data to be analysed by any recognition system supporting a set of common standards. 7. Synthesis and applications. Microphone arrays are increasingly used to remotely monitor acoustically active animals. We provide examples from a variety of taxa where acoustic arrays have been used for ecological, behavioural and conservation studies. We discuss the technologies used, the methodologies for automating signal recognition and some of the remaining challenges. We also make recommendations for using this technology to aid in wildlife management. © 2011 The Authors.

Recent evidence suggests that this enzyme plays a role in cell survival and ribosome biogenesis. Here we report that hYVH1 expression also affects cell cycle progression. Overexpression of hYVH1 caused a significant increase in polyploidy and in the G2/M cell population with a subsequent decrease in the G0/G1 population. Phosphatase activity is dispensable, while the zinc binding domain is necessary and sufficient for hYVH1-mediated cell cycle changes. In agreement with this, siRNA-mediated silencing of hYVH1 expression resulted in a dramatic increase in the G0/G1 population and susceptibility to cellular senescence. Additionally, mass spectrometry-based methods identified novel hYVH1 phosphorylation sites including a C-terminal modification at position Ser335 in the zinc binding domain. Interestingly, phosphorylation at Ser335 regulates subcellular targeting of hYVH1 and augments the hYVH1 G2/M phenotype. Collectively we demonstrate that hYVH1 is a novel modulator of cell cycle progression; a function mainly mediated by its C-terminal zinc binding domain. © 2011 Landes Bioscience.",Cell cycle | Dual-specificity phosphatase | DUSP12 | Phosphorylation sites | YVH1,15,1,,undefined,

Results revealed that this subunit was expressed throughout the auditory system with the level being high in the layers I-V of the auditory cortex, medial geniculate nucleus, dorsomedial and lateral parts of the inferior colliculus, and the molecular and fusiform cell layers of the dorsal cochlear nucleus. Labeled cell bodies were found in all the areas showing immunoreactivity. Neuropil labeling was strong in areas with high overall levels of immunoreactivity.

No differences in immunoreactivity were found between the core and the belt areas of the auditory cortex and among the subdivisions of the medial geniculate nucleus.

In the current study, we use highly polymorphic microsatellite markers to evaluate local dispersal and colonization dynamics of the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), an aquatic invader expanding its range from lake to river environments in its introduced North American range. Genetic structure, genotype assignment and genetic diversity were compared among 1262 round gobies from 20 river and four lake sites in three Great Lakes tributaries. Our results indicate that a combination of short-distance diffusion and long-distance dispersal, collectively referred to as stratified dispersal, is facilitating river colonization. Colonization proceeded upstream yearly (approximately 500 m/year; 2005-2009) in one of two temporal replicates while genetic structure was temporally stable. Contiguous dispersal from the lake was observed in all three rivers with a substantial portion of river fish (7.3%) identified as migrants. Genotype assignment indicated a separate introduction occurred upstream of the invasion front in one river. Genetic diversity was similar and relatively high among lake and recently colonized river populations, indicating that founder effects are mitigated through a dual-dispersal strategy. The remarkable success of round goby as an aquatic invader stresses the need for better diffusion models of secondary range expansion for presumably sessile invasive species. © 2011 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",colonization | conservation genetics | invasive species | secondary range expansion | stratified dispersal,65,0,,undefined,

In birds, male vocalizations are known to play a critical role in territory defence. Territorial acoustic signals in females have been poorly studied, perhaps because female song is uncommon in north-temperate ecosystems. In this study, we compare male vs. female territorial singing behaviour in Neotropical rufous-and-white wrens Thryothorus rufalbus, a species where both sexes produce solo songs and often coordinate their songs in vocal duets. We recorded free-living birds in Costa Rica using an eight-microphone Acoustic Location System capable of passively triangulating the position of animals based on their vocalizations. We recorded 17 pairs of birds for 2-4 consecutive mornings and calculated the territory of each individual as a 95% fixed kernel estimate around their song posts. We compared territories calculated around male vs. female song posts, including separate analyses of solo vs. duet song posts. These spatial analyses of singing behaviour reveal that males and females use similarly sized territories with more than 60% overlap between breeding partners. Territories calculated based on solo vs. duet song posts were of similar size and similar degrees of overlap. Solos and duets were performed at similar distances from the nest for both sexes. Overall, male and female rufous-and-white wrens exhibit very similar spatial territorial singing behaviour, demonstrating congruent patterns of male and female territoriality. © 2011 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,8,0,,undefined,

Evaluating feeding strategies and habitat use of neonates is consequently complicated by the maternal isotopic signal and its subsequent elimination with growth. Thus, methods that measure the loss of the maternal signal, i.e. when the isotopic signal of a neonate reflects its own diet, are needed. Values of δ13C and δ15N were measured in liver and muscle tissues of <1 year old bull (Carcharhinus leucas) and Atlantic sharpnose (Rhizoprionodon terraenovae) sharks and related to age using, total length, date sampled and umbilical scar stage (USS). We observed a decline in δ13C and δ15N values with age that was different among species, similar among isotopes, and greater in liver than in muscle; highlighting that retention of the maternal signal is dependent on species-specific life history and tissue characteristics. USS was most effective for assessing the loss of the maternal isotopic signal in the faster growing Atlantic sharpnose shark, but was less effective for the slower growing bull shark. Total length and date sampled were overall less effective and may be more informative for slower growing species when coupled with USS, as variable size at birth and misclassification of animals >1 year old, which remain in nursery habitats, increase the variability of the isotopic values. Consideration of the maternal signal and measuring its loss are thus necessary when analyzing the stable isotopes of young animals, as there is potential to misinterpret feeding strategies, over-estimate trophic position and incorrectly assign carbon source.

This paper explores the role of a habitat-modeling methodological approach, agent-based modeling, which we advocate as a promising approach for ecological research. Agent-based models (ABMs) are capable of simultaneously distinguishing animal densities from habitat quality, can explicitly represent the environment and its dynamism, can accommodate spatial patterns of inter- and intra-species mechanisms, and can explore feedbacks and adaptations inherent in these systems. ABMs comprise autonomous, individual entities; each with dynamic, adaptive behaviors and heterogeneous characteristics that interact with each other and with their environment. These interactions result in emergent outcomes that can be used to quantitatively examine critical habitats from the individual- to population-level. ABMs can also explore how wildlife will respond to potential changes in environmental conditions, since they can readily incorporate adaptive animal-movement ecology in a changing landscape. This paper describes the necessary elements of an ABM developed specifically for understanding wildlife habitat selection, reviews the current empirical literature on ABMs in wildlife ecology and management, and evaluates the current and future roles these ABMs can play, specifically with regards to scenario planning of designated critical habitats. © 2011 Elsevier B.V.",Agent-based model | Animal learning | Conservation planning | Environmental representation | Habitat modeling | Movement ecology,86,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

The start of the dawn chorus in songbirds is influenced by a variety of internal factors (e.g. circadian rhythms) and external factors (e.g. light levels, social cues). Here we investigate whether the start time of the dawn chorus is influenced by the singing behaviour of conspecific competitors. Using an Acoustic Location System, we recorded the dawn chorus in neighbourhoods of 5-10 black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus. We used playback to simulate an unfamiliar male performing a dawn song bout within an existing male's territory. Playback began 15. min before the earliest song sung by any male on the preceding day. Focal males began singing a mean ± SE of 4.3 ± 1.6. min earlier on the day of playback (time relative to sunrise), significantly earlier than on the previous day. We also found a significant communication network level response where neighbouring males began singing 2.3 ± 0.8. min earlier in response to playback. Dawn song bouts of males that received playback were longer, but ended at a similar point relative to sunrise. As this effect of a simulated conspecific on chorus start time is on the scale of only a few minutes, other factors probably play a significant role in shaping the timing of dawn chorus onset. Our results show that animals adjust the timing of their sexual communication in response to increased levels of competition. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Acoustic Location System | Black-capped chickadee | Communication network | Dawn chorus | Playback | Territorial insertion,19,0,,undefined,Society of Canadian Ornithologists

(2) Is the management action effective under operational conditions? (3) Can compliance be achieved on a broad scale? (4) Are desired changes observed in the environment? The four lines of evidence resulting from this analysis indicate that the Great Lakes ballast water management program provides robust, but not complete, protection against ship-mediated biological invasions. Our analysis also indicates that corresponding inspection and enforcement efforts should be undertaken to ensure that environmental policies translate into increased environmental protection.

The most effective way to manage nonindigenous species and their impacts is to prevent their introduction via vector regulation. While ships' ballast water is very well studied and this vector is actively managed, hull fouling has received far less attention and regulations are only now being considered despite its importance for introductions to coastal, marine systems. 2. We conducted comprehensive in situ sampling and video recording of hulls of 40 transoceanic vessels to assess propagule and colonization pressure in Vancouver and Halifax, dominant coastal ports in Canada. Concomitant sampling was conducted of harbour fouling communities to compare hull and port communities as part of a vector risk assessment. 3. Although this vector has been operational for a long time, hull and harbour communities were highly divergent, with mean Sørensen's similarity values of 0·03 in Halifax and 0·01 in Vancouver, suggesting invasion risk is high. Propagule pressure (up to 600 000 ind. ship-1) and colonization pressure (up to 156 species ship-1) were high and varied significantly between ports, with Vancouver receiving much higher abundances and diversity of potential invaders. The higher risk of fouling introductions in Vancouver is consistent with historical patterns of successful hull fouling invasions. 4. The extent of hull fouling was modelled using ship history predictors. Propagule pressure increased with time spent in previous ports-of-call and time since last application of antifouling paint, whereas colonization pressure increased with time since last painting and with the number of regions visited by the ship. Both propagule and colonization pressure were negatively related to the time spent at sea and the latitude of ports visited. 5. Synthesis and applications. A major challenge for applied invasion ecology is the effective management of introduction vectors. We found that hull fouling has a strong potential for introduction of many species to coastal marine habitats and that management should be considered. Simple variables related to the vessels' hull husbandry, voyage, and sailing patterns may be used to predict and manage hull fouling intensity. The results presented here should interest policy makers and environmental managers who seek to reduce invasion risk, and ship owners seeking to optimize fuel efficiency. © 2011 The Authors.

Cleaning associations between sharks and teleosts are poorly understood, but the observable interactions seen at this site may explain why these mainly oceanic sharks regularly venture into shallow coastal waters where they are vulnerable to disturbance from human activity. From 1,230 hours of observations recorded by remote video camera between July 2005 and December 2009, 97 cleaner-thresher shark events were analyzed, 19 of which were interrupted. Observations of pelagic thresher sharks interacting with cleaners at the seamount were recorded at all times of day but their frequency declined gradually from morning until evening. Cleaners showed preferences for foraging on specific areas of a thresher shark's body. For all events combined, cleaners were observed to conduct 2,757 inspections, of which 33.9% took place on the shark's pelvis, 23.3% on the pectoral fins, 22.3% on the caudal fin, 8.6% on the body, 8.3% on the head, 2.1% on the dorsal fin, and 1.5% on the gills respectively. Cleaners did not preferentially inspect thresher sharks by time of day or by shark sex, but there was a direct correlation between the amount of time a thresher shark spent at a cleaning station and the number of inspections it received. Thresher shark clients modified their behavior by ""circular-stance-swimming,"" presumably to facilitate cleaner inspections. The cleaner-thresher shark association reflected some of the known behavioral trends in the cleaner-reef teleost system since cleaners appeared to forage selectively on shark clients. Evidence is mounting that in addition to acting as social refuges and foraging grounds for large visiting marine predators, seamounts may also support pelagic ecology by functioning as cleaning stations for oceanic sharks and rays. © 2011 Oliver et al.",,18,1,,undefined,

Human activity can also influence the distribution of wildlife species. In particular, high-human disturbance can displace large carnivore predators, a trait-mediated direct effect. Predator displacement by humans could then indirectly benefit prey species by reducing predation risk, a trait-mediated indirect effect of humans that spatially decouples predators from prey. The purpose of this research was to test the hypothesis that high-human activity was displacing predators and thus indirectly creating spatial refuge for prey species, helping prey win the ""space race"". We measured the occurrence of eleven large mammal species (including humans and cattle) at 43 camera traps deployed on roads and trails in southwest Alberta, Canada. We tested species co-occurrence at camera sites using hierarchical cluster and nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMS) analyses; and tested whether human activity, food and/or habitat influenced predator and prey species counts at camera sites using regression tree analysis. Cluster and NMS analysis indicated that at camera sites humans co-occurred with prey species more than predator species and predator species had relatively low co-occurrence with prey species. Regression tree analysis indicated that prey species were three times more abundant on roads and trails with >32 humans/day. However, predators were less abundant on roads and trails that exceeded 18 humans/day. Our results support the hypothesis that high-human activity displaced predators but not prey species, creating spatial refuge from predation. High-human activity on roads and trails (i.e., >18 humans/day) has the potential to interfere with predator-prey interactions via trait-mediated direct and indirect effects. We urge scientist and managers to carefully consider and quantify the trait-mediated indirect effects of humans, in addition to direct effects, when assessing human impacts on wildlife and ecosystems. © 2011 Muhly et al.",,86,1,,undefined,

One potential cue for locating settlement habitats that has received recent interest is acoustic cues from reef habitats. Although it is clear that settlement-stage fish larvae can hear, it is less clear how hearing ability develops during the larval phase, or how auditory abilities vary among species and families. Auditory-evoked potentials were used to investigate hearing in larvae of 5 fishes (Epinephelus coioides, E. fuscoguttatus, Serranidae; Eleutheronema tetradactylum, Polynemidae; Caranx ignobilis, Carangidae; and Macquaria novemaculeata, Percichthyidae) over a range of sizes (9 to 28 mm). Ontogenetic improvement in hearing of up to 25 dB was found in 4 species. We also assessed hearing ability within and between 4 families (Serranidae, Lutjanidae, Pomacentridae and Carangidae) using larger larvae of 11 species from tropical and warm temperate habitats (the serranids and carangid above plus Epinephelus malabaricus, Plectropomus leopardus, Lutjanus carponotatus, L. sebae, Pomacentrus nagasakiensis, P. amboinensis, Gnathanodon speciosus and Elagatis bipinnulata). Within pomacentrids, carangids and lutjanids, hearing sensitivity differences among species were found. This high within-family variance results in no difference in hearing ability among the 4 families. A key component of modelling reef connectivity is the estimation of larval attraction distances. The data provided herein clearly demonstrate that attraction varies both ontogenetically and among species. Both developmental stage and species must be taken into account when estimating distances over which sound cues emanating from settlement habitats can be detected. © Inter-Research 2011.",Audiogram | Auditory-evoked potentials | Connectivity | Dispersal | Hearing ability | Larvae | Marine teleost fishes | Ontogeny,37,1,,undefined,

The invasion sequence is a useful concept in predictions of spread, as it allows us to test hypotheses about the transport and establishment of propagules in novel habitats. Our aims are twofold: (1) to develop and validate multi-stage invasion models for the introduced fishhook waterflea, Cercopagis pengoi, and (2) to assess how variability in the transport patterns of the propagules influences the accuracy and spatial extent for predictions of spread. Location New York State, USA. Methods We developed a two-stage model for the spread of C. pengoi. First, we developed a stochastic gravity model for dispersal based on surveys of recreational boat traffic in New York State as a proxy for propagule pressure. We then modelled the probability of establishment based on predicted levels of propagule pressure and measures of lakes' physicochemistry. In addition, we used Monte Carlo simulations based on the gravity model to propagate variability in boater traffic through the establishment model to assess how uncertainty in dispersal influenced predictions of spread. Results The amount recreationalists were willing to spend, lake area and population size of the city nearest to the destination lake were significant factors affecting boater traffic. In turn, boater traffic, lake area, specific conductance and turbidity were significant predictors of establishment. The inclusion of stochastic dispersal reduced the rate of false positives (i.e. incorrect prediction of an invasion) in detecting invasions at the upper 95% prediction interval for the probability of establishment.

Haplotype and nucleotide diversities for B. schlosseri were significantly higher than for B. violaceus both globally (h = 0.872; π = 0. 054 and h = 0.461; π = 0.007, respectively) and in their overlapping North American ranges (h = 0.874; π = 0.012 and h = 0.384; π = 0.006, respectively). Comparative population genetics and phylogenetic analyses revealed clear differences in patterns of invasion for these two species. B. schlosseri populations on the west and east coasts of North America were seeded from the Pacific and Mediterranean regions, respectively, whereas all North American B. violaceus populations were founded by one or more introduction events from Japan. Differences in genetic structure of invasive populations for these species in North America are consistent with their contrasting probable introduction vectors.

Here we investigated sequence variation in the nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer region of the ctenophore Mnemiopsis leidyi, a species considered one of the most invasive globally. We surveyed four populations from the native distribution range along the Atlantic coasts of the United States and South America, as well as six populations in the introduced range from the Black, Azov, Caspian and Baltic seas. Allelic and nucleotide diversity of introduced populations were comparable to those of native populations from which they were likely drawn. Introduced populations typically exhibited lower genetic differentiation (FST = -0.014-0.421) than native populations (FST = 0.324-0.688). Population genetic analyses supported the invasion of Eurasia from at least two different pathways, the first from the Gulf of Mexico (e.g., Tampa Bay) to the Black Sea and thence to the Caspian Sea, the second from the northern part of the native distribution range (e.g., Narragansett Bay) to the Baltic Sea. The relatively high genetic diversity observed in introduced populations is consistent with large inocula and/or multiple invasions, both of which are possible given ballast water transport and the extensive native distribution of the ctenophore in the Atlantic Ocean. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Ctenophore | Genetic diversity | Internal transcribed spacer (ITS) | Invasive species | Mnemiopsis leidyi | Non-indigenous species (NIS),42,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Indeed, theoretical models suggest that GH transgenic animals could, under specific conditions, decimate local populations. However, while there are numerous laboratory examinations of factors affecting survival of transgenic and wild animals, we know little about the competitive reproductive capacity of transgenic animals. Here, we examined the reproductive capabilities of cultured GH transgenic coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch) when in competition with wild coho derived from nature using semi-natural mating arenas (within a contained facility). To account for the well-known reproductive impairments associated with culturing salmon in laboratory facilities we contrasted the competitive reproductive success of GH transgenic coho against that of cultured non-transgenic coho. We also performed in vitro sperm analyses to assess the postcopulatory competitive ability of GH transgenic coho. In competitive mating arenas, transgenic coho performed fewer courtship and aggressive behaviours than coho from nature and sired less than 6% of offspring. Non-transgenic cultured coho, despite their smaller body size, sired more than twice as many offspring than transgenic coho when competing against wild coho in mating arenas. Transgenic males also face a postcopulatory reproductive disadvantage as their ejaculates contained fewer sperm that swam slower and for shorter durations than sperm from wild males. Together, these findings suggest limited potential for the transmission of transgenes from cultured GH transgenic coho salmon through natural matings should they escape from a contained culture facility into nature and reproductively interact with a local wild coho salmon strain. However, as responses of wild-reared fish can differ greatly from those of cultured fish, we stress the importance of understanding genotype-by-environment interactions for reproductive phenotypes when developing risk assessment information. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Aquaculture | Ecological impact | Genetic modification | Genetically engineered organisms | Sperm competition,27,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Interestingly, the opposite occurs with another Plk family member, Plk1 which was typically hypermethylated in normal liver tissue but became hypomethylated and upregulated in liver tumours. Furthermore, upon alcohol exposure murine embryonic fibroblasts exhibited increased Plk4 hypermethylation and downregulation along with increased centrosome numbers and multinucleation.Conclusions: These results suggest that aberrant Plk methylation is correlated with the development of HCC in mice. © 2011 Ward et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,11,1,,undefined,

Transcription was measured before and after a 24-h saltwater challenge in pure and reciprocal hybrid offspring of fish from both populations reared in a common environment for two generations. Significant differences between the landlocked and migratory populations were observed, particularly in fresh water at the NaK ATPase1αa and GHRII genes, indicating rapid evolutionary change, possibly associated with reduced energy expenditure in the landlocked lake system. Phenotypic divergence analysis (QST) shows that the observed transcriptional differences deviate from neutral expectations. Some reciprocal crosses exhibited anomalous transcription consistent with sex-linked epistatic or genetic imprinting effects.

Sperm competition theory predicts there should be a trade-off between investment in attracting mates and investment in ejaculate quality. In contrast, the phenotype-linked fertility hypothesis predicts a positive relationship should exist between investment in attracting mates and investment in ejaculate quality. Given the need to understand how pre- and post-copulatory sexual selection interacts, we investigated the relationship between secondary sexual traits and ejaculate quality using the European house cricket, Acheta domesticus. Although we found no direct relationship between cricket secondary sexual signals and ejaculate quality, variation in ejaculate quality was dependent on male body weight and mating latency: the lightest males produced twice as many sperm as the heaviest males but took longer to mate with females. Our findings are consistent with current theoretical models of sperm competition. Given light males may have lower mating success than heavy males because females take longer to mate with them in no-choice tests, light males may be exhibiting an alternative reproductive tactic by providing females with more living sperm. Together, our findings suggest that the fitness of heavy males may depend on pre-copulatory sexual selection, while the fitness of light males may depend on post-copulatory fertilization success. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,14,0,,undefined,

Here, we study the dynamics of postestablishment colonization in the colonial ascidian Botrylloides violaceus, a notorious marine invader. After its initial introduction from the Northwest Pacific, B. violaceus spread rapidly along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America, impacting both aquaculture facilities and natural ecosystems. We compare genetic diversity and patterns of gene flow among 25 populations (N = 679) from the West and East coasts, and evaluate the contribution of sexual vs. asexual reproduction to this species' invasion success using data from the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) gene and 13 nuclear polymorphic microsatellite loci. Our results reveal contrasting patterns of spread in the coastal waters of North America. While the West coast was colonized by noncontiguous (long-distance) dispersal, the East coast invasion appears to have occurred through contiguous (stepping-stone) spread. Molecular data further indicate that although dispersal in colonial ascidians is predominantly achieved through sexually produced propagules, aquaculture practices such as high-pressure washing can facilitate fragmentation and potentially exacerbate infestations and spread via asexual propagules. The results presented here suggest that caution should be used against the general assumption that all invasions, even within a single species, exhibit similar patterns of colonization, as highly contrasting dynamics may transpire in different invaded ranges. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",clonal genotypes | colonial ascidian | invasive species | isolation by distance | phylogeography | population genetics,36,0,,undefined,

An enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) for 3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-androstane-11,17-dione (11-O-ETIO) has been used to show a substantial rise in the rate of release of immunoreactive compounds into the water when males are injected with salmon gonadotropin releasing hormone analogue. Similar increases were noted for 11-ketotestosterone and 17,20beta-dihydroxypregn-4-en-3-one. Partitioning of the extracts between diethyl ether and water showed the presence of both free and conjugated immunoreactive 11-O-ETIO. Only conjugated immunoreactivity was found in urine (implying that free steroid is released via the gills). The identity of the conjugates was probed by using HPLC, EIA, and mass spectrometry and removal of sulfate and glucosiduronate groups. Immunoreactivity in the conjugated fraction was found to be due mainly to 3alpha,17-beta-dihydroxy-5beta-androstan- 11-one 17-sulfate. However, the evidence was also strong for the presence in water extracts of substantial amounts of 3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-androstane-11,17- dione 3-glucosiduronate (which could be detected only by EIA after removal of the glucosiduronate group with betaglucuronidase). There were also small amounts of 3alphahydroxy-5beta-androstane-11,17-dione 3-sulfate and 3alpha,17-beta-dihydroxy-5beta-androstan-11-one 17-glucosiduronate. These studies give some idea of the types, amounts, and ratios of 11-O-ETIO derivatives that are released by reproductive N. melanostomus and will aid further research into the putative pheromonal roles of 5beta,3alpha-reduced androgens in this species. © 2011 by the Society for the Study of Reproduction, Inc.",Androgen | Fish steroids | Pheromone | Testis,21,1,,undefined,

The report made several recommendations that if addressed would allow the forensic sciences to develop a stronger scientific foundation. We suggest a roadmap for decomposition ecology and forensic entomology hinging on a framework built on basic research concepts in ecology, evolution, and genetics. Unifying both basic and applied research fields under a common umbrella of terminology and structure would facilitate communication in the field and the production of scientific results. It would also help to identify novel research areas leading to a better understanding of principal underpinnings governing ecosystem structure, function, and evolution while increasing the accuracy of and ability to interpret entomological evidence collected from crime scenes. By following the proposed roadmap, a bridge can be built between basic and applied decomposition ecology research, culminating in science that could withstand the rigors of emerging legal and cultural expectations. © 2011 by Annual Reviews.

Hypotheses for the function of duets can be grouped into two broad categories to explain why individuals coordinate with their partner's songs to create duets: (1) duets are cooperative displays where pair members have a shared goal, such as joint resource defence, and (2) duets are conflicting displays where pair members have different goals, such as guarding against divorce or extrapair copulations. To distinguish between cooperative versus conflicting functions of vocal duets, we conducted a playback experiment to 40 breeding pairs of barred antshrikes, Thamnophilus doliatus. We broadcast five playback treatments to territorial pairs of birds: solos of males and females, duets created by males responding to female songs and by females responding to male songs, and a heterospecific control. We categorized subjects' behaviour in terms of vocal and physical responses. Male vocal and physical responses were significantly higher towards conspecific stimuli than towards heterospecific stimuli. Males tended to show more vocal responsiveness towards duet stimuli, although this tendency was not significant. We observed a similar pattern for female vocal responses. However, for physical responses, females showed significantly more intense responses towards female solo stimuli than towards any other conspecific treatment, suggesting that female antshrikes perceive rival females as an especially intense threat. Our results provide some support for a joint resource defence function for duetting in this species, while the high intrasexual aggression observed between females may indicate a form of mate guarding. © 2011 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",Antbird | Barred antshrike | Conflict | Cooperation | Duet | Playback | Suboscine songbird | Territory defence | Thamnophilus doliatus,16,0,,undefined,Government of Ontario

All Cks homologues have the ability to associate with Cyclin dependent kinases (Cdks) and in many cases this interaction has been shown to be important for function. Here we characterize the null and RNAi knockdown phenotype of the Drosophila Cks1 (Cks85A) gene. Cks85A is essential for viability in Drosophila. Cks85A null animals have reduced overall growth and this correlates with reduced ploidy and impaired DNA replication in endoreplicating cells. Interestingly, Cks85A is also required for the maintenance of diploidy in mitotically cycling cells. The requirement for Cks85A in growth is similar to that of the mammalian Cks1, which was found to interact with the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase. We identified the Drosophila Skp2 gene and generated null alleles. Comparison of these mutants to null mutants for Cks85A reveals a remarkably similar dual requirement in growth and in maintenance of diploidy. We find that Cks85A interacts directly with the SCFSkp2 ubiquitin ligase and genetic evidence indicates that this is its major molecular function. The closely related Cks30A cannot interact with the SCFSkp2 and cannot functionally compensate for loss of Cks85A. We also find that the critical growth promoting and diploidy maintaining functions of Cks85A and Skp2 are independent of known SCFSkp2 substrates, p27 and Cdt1, indicating that other critical substrates remain to be identified. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.",Cell cycle | Cks | Drosophila | Genome instability | SCF | Skp2,4,1,,2008–13159,Canadian Cancer Society

We took advantage of the appearance of an avian cholera epizootic in an arctic colony of common eiders Somateria mollissima to study variation in juvenile survival and selection on hatch characteristics in relation to this highly infectious disease. Avian cholera is one of the most important infectious diseases affecting wild birds and is thought to primarily affect adult survival. Here, we show that avian cholera was associated with a 90% decline in duckling survival, leading to almost zero recruitment. Before the cholera outbreak, there was significant stabilizing selection on hatching date and significant positive directional selection on hatching mass. During cholera outbreaks, selection on hatch characteristics was no longer significant. These results were based on a low sample of surviving ducklings in cholera years, but suggested that date and mass at hatching did no longer affect duckling survival in the presence of cholera. These effects of avian cholera on post-hatching survival were likely not only the consequence of the disease per se, but also a consequence of an increase in predation rates that followed the emergence of avian cholera. Our results emphasize the dramatic direct and indirect impacts that infectious disease can have on vital rates, and thus population dynamics. © 2011 The Authors.",,18,0,,undefined,

We describe the plug-in's functionality, and confirm its validity for sperm head morphology analysis using fish sperm. Sperm head morphological measurements (length and width) made with the ASMA plug-in did not differ from manual measurements. Using the plug-in to measure sperm head-shaped objects of known size, the associated plug-in error rate was < 0.5%. Brightness and contrast ratios influenced sperm head measurements, suggesting the need for standardized protocols. This plug-in was effective at measuring elliptical (i.e., Atlantic cod) as well as slightly irregular (i.e., Chinook salmon) shaped sperm heads.

Biogenic CH4 accumulates to high concentrations (up to 1.4 mmol L-1) in the anoxic bottom waters, which contain a total of 7.4 × 105 tons of CH4. Profiles of dissolved inorganic carbon (ΣCO2) and carbon isotopes (δ13C) show that CH4 is oxidized in the vicinity of the persistent pycnocline and that some of this CH4 is likely oxidized anaerobically. The dearth of NO3- and SO42- in Lake Matano waters suggests that anaerobic methane oxidation may be coupled to the reduction of Fe (and/or Mn) (hydr)oxides. Thermodynamic considerations reveal that CH4 oxidation coupled to Fe(III) or Mn(III/IV) reduction would yield sufficient free energy to support microbial growth at the substrate levels present in Lake Matano. Flux calculations imply that Fe and Mn must be recycled several times directly within the water column to balance the upward flux of CH4. 16S gene cloning identified methanogens in the anoxic water column, and these methanogens belong to groups capable of both acetoclastic and hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. We find that methane is important in C cycling, even in this very Fe-rich environment. Such Fe-rich environments are rare on Earth today, but they are analogous to conditions in the ferruginous oceans thought to prevail during much of the Archean Eon. By analogy, methanogens and methanotrophs could have formed an important part of the Archean Ocean ecosystem. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,99,0,,undefined,

In the adult Drosophila midgut, the Jun N-Terminal Kinase (JNK) pathway is activated in damaged enterocyte cells (ECs) following injury. This leads to the production of Upd cytokines from ECs, which in turn activate the Janus kinase (JAK)/Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway in Intestinal SCs (ISCs), stimulating their proliferation. In addition, the Hippo pathway has been recently implicated in the regulation of Upd production from the ECs. Here, we show that the Hippo pathway target, Yorkie (Yki), also plays a crucial and cell-autonomous role in ISCs. Activation of Yki in ISCs is sufficient to increase ISC proliferation, a process involving Yki target genes that promote division, survival and the Upd cytokines. We further show that prior to injury, Yki activity is constitutively repressed by the upstream Hippo pathway members Fat and Dachsous (Ds). These findings demonstrate a cell-autonomous role for the Hippo pathway in SCs, and have implications for understanding the role of this pathway in tumorigenesis and cancer stem cells.",Drosophila | Hippo pathway | Intestinal stem cell | Regeneration,201,1,,undefined,

In order to effectively conserve and manage these populations, knowledge of the evolutionary adaptive state of individuals and the scale of adaptation across populations is needed. The vertebrate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) represents an important adaptation to parasites, and genes encoding for the MHC are widely held to be undergoing balancing selection. However, the generality of balancing selection across populations at MHC loci is not well documented. Using Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from two populations, we follow the survival of full-sib family replicates reared in their natal river and reciprocally transplanted to a foreign river to examine selection and local adaptation at the MHC class I and II loci. In both populations, we found evidence of a survivorship advantage associated with nucleotide diversity at the MHC class I locus. In contrast, we found evidence that MHC class II diversity was disadvantageous in one population. There was no evidence that these effects occurred in translocated families, suggesting some degree of local adaptation at the MHC loci. Thus, our results implicate balancing selection at the MHC class I but potentially differing selection across populations at the class II locus. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Adaptive divergence | Balancing selection | Chinook salmon | Directional selection | Major histocompatibility complex | Nucleotide divergence | Survival,19,0,NSERC,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Laboratory reared guppies (Poecilia reticulata) fed a series of diets with a range of δ13C (-22.9 to -6.6‰) and δ15N (6.5 to 1586‰) values were used to magnify diet-tissue dynamics in order to calculate DDFs once the fish had achieved equilibrium with each of the diets. Values of DDFs range widely for δ15N (7.1 to -849‰) and δ13C (1.1 to -7.0‰) and showed a strong negative correlation with the stable isotope value in the food for δ15N (slope = -0.59 ± 0.02, r2 = 0.95) and δ13C (slope = -0.56 ± 0.02, r2 = 0.94). Based on these relationships, the magnitude of DDF change over environmentally relevant values of δ15N or δ13C would be significant and could confound the interpretation of stable isotopes in the environment. Using highly enriched experimental diets, our study adds to a growing number of studies that undermine the consistent trophic enrichment paradigm with results that demonstrate the currently poor mechanistic understanding of how DDFs arise. The results of our study highlight that the magnitude of the stable isotope values in prey must be considered when choosing DDF values. Future laboratory studies should therefore be directed at uncovering the mechanistic basis of DDFs and, like others before, we recommend the determination of diet-dependent DDFs under laboratory conditions before modeling dietary proportions or calculating trophic positions.

These reactions are important for daily activities, reproduction, and survival. In the sea lamprey, mating occurs after ovulated females are attracted to spawning sites by male sex pheromones. The ubiquity and reliability of olfactory-motor behavioral responses in vertebrates suggest tight coupling between the olfactory system and brain areas controlling movements. However, the circuitry and the underlying cellular neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. Using lamprey brain preparations, and electrophysiology, calcium imaging, and tract tracing experiments, we describe the neural substrate responsible for transforming an olfactory input into a locomotor output. We found that olfactory stimulation with naturally occurring odors and pheromones induced large excitatory responses in reticulospinal cells, the command neurons for locomotion. We have also identified the anatomy and physiology of this circuit. The olfactory input was relayed in the medial part of the olfactory bulb, in the posterior tuberculum, in the mesencephalic locomotor region, to finally reach reticulospinal cells in the hindbrain. Activation of this olfactory-motor pathway generated rhythmic ventral root discharges and swimming movements. Our study bridges the gap between behavior and cellular neural mechanisms in vertebrates, identifying a specific subsystem within the CNS, dedicated to producing motor responses to olfactory inputs. © 2010 Derjean et al.",,40,1,,undefined,

We used the Drosophila temperature-sensitive dynamin mutant, shibire-ts1, to block endocytosis of recycling synaptic vesicles and to trap them reversibly at the plasma membrane where they were accessible to sterol extraction. Depletion of sterols from trapped vesicles prevented recovery of synaptic transmission after removal of the endocytic block. Measurement of vesicle recycling with synaptopHluorin, FM1-43, and FM4-64 demonstrated impaired membrane retrieval after vesicular sterol depletion. When plasma membrane sterols were extracted before vesicle trapping, no vesicle recycling defects were observed. Ultrastructural analysis indicated accumulation of endosomes and a defect in the formation of synaptic vesicles in synaptic terminals subjected to vesicular sterol depletion. Our results demonstrate the importance of a high vesicular sterol concentration for endocytosis and suggest that vesicular and membrane sterol pools do not readily intermingle during vesicle recycling.

Considerable attention has been directed towards the extrinsic forces of speciation-the geological, geographical and ecological peculiarities of ancient lakes. Recently, there has been a resurgence of interest in the intrinsic nature of these radiations, the biological characteristics conducive to speciation. While new species are thought to arise mainly by the gradual enhancement of reproductive isolation among geographically isolated populations, ancient lakes provide little evidence for a predominant role of geography in speciation. Recent phylogenetic work provides strong evidence that multiple colonization waves were followed by parallel intralacustrine radiations that proceeded at relatively rapid rates despite long-term gene flow through hybridization and introgression. Several studies suggest that hybridization itself might act as a key evolutionary mechanism by triggering major genomic reorganization/revolution and enabling the colonization of new ecological niches in ancient lakes. These studies propose that hybridization is not only of little impediment to diversification but could act as an important force in facilitating habitat transitions, promoting postcolonization adaptations and accelerating diversification. Emerging ecological genomic approaches are beginning to shed light on the long-standing evolutionary dilemma of speciation in the face of gene flow. We propose an integrative programme for future studies on speciation in ancient lakes. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",adaptive radiation | ecological innovations | gene flow | hybridization | reproductive isolation | speciation,35,0,,undefined,

To explore this, we examined the spatial and temporal variation in population genetic structure of adult and recently settled bicolor damselfish Stegastes partitus, a coral reef fish. We genotyped adult and juvenile fish from 10 sites over 4 sample years at 9 microsatellite loci. We show spatial heterogeneity in adult and juvenile population structure; however, we found no evidence of a pattern of spatial genetic divergence. Furthermore, genetic structure changed through time and between life stages in an unpredictable manner. Using these data, we test whether pre- or post- settlement selection, sweepstakes effects or variability in connectivity can explain the observed chaotic genetic patchiness. Our results indicate that the contributions of various larval sources likely change through time as a result of stochastic processes such as oceanographic flow. Our results have implications for the management of marine populations, as spatial and temporal variability in connectivity may act to promote long term stability of populations. Therefore it is important that marine management efforts account for such heterogeneity in the design of protected areas. © Inter-Research 2010.",Chaotic genetic patchiness | Connectivity | Coral reef fish | Genetic structure | Larval dispersal | Temporal variability,43,1,,undefined,

The precise mechanisms by which many of these GPCRs modulate specific signaling cascades to regulate neural function are not well defined. We used Drosophila melanogaster as a model to examine both the cellular and behavioral effects of DPKQDFMRFamide, the most abundant peptide encoded by the dFMRF gene. We show that DPKQDFMRFamide enhanced synaptic transmission through activation of two G-protein-coupled receptors, Fmrf Receptor (FR) and Dromyosupressin Receptor-2 (DmsR-2). The peptide increased both the presynaptic Ca2+ response and the quantal content of released transmitter. Peptide-induced modulation of synaptic function could be abrogated by depleting intracellular Ca2+ stores or by interfering with Ca2+ release from the endoplasmic reticulum through disruption of either the ryanodine receptor or the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor. The peptide also altered behavior. Exogenous DPKQDFMRFamide enhanced fictive locomotion; this required both the FR and DmsR-2. Likewise, both receptors were required for an escape response to intense light exposure. Thus, coincident detection of a peptide by two GPCRs modulates synaptic function through effects of Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release, and we hypothesize that these mechanisms are involved in behavioral responses to environmental stress.

Accordingly, the ability to mitigate negative impacts of tourism on wildlife necessitates research into the ecology of the system and of the human dimensions, since plans aimed at optimizing wildlife fitness must also be acceptable to tourists. We developed an integrated systems dynamics model for the management of tourist-stingray interactions at 'Stingray City Sandbar' (SCS), Cayman Islands. The model predicts the state of the tourism attraction over time in relation to stingray population size, stingray life expectancy, and tourist visitation under various management scenarios. Stingray population data in the model comprised growth rates and survival estimates (from mark-and-recapture data) and mortality estimates. Inputted changes in their respective rates under different management scenarios were informed by previous research. Original research on the demand of heterogeneous tourist segments for management regulations via a stated choice model was used to calculate changes in the tourist population growth rate from data supplied by the Caymanian government. The management attributes to which tourists were responsive also have anticipated effects on stingray ecology (migration and mortality), and vice versa, thus linking the two components. We found that the model's predictions over a 25-year time span were sensitive to the stingray population growth rate and alternate management options. Under certain management scenarios, it was possible to maximize both the tourist segment in favor of no management and stingray numbers while reducing stingray health. However, the most effective relative strategy included a reduction in visitor density, restricted stingray interactions, and an imposition of a small fee. Over time, although fewer stingrays were predicted to remain at SCS, they would live longer and experience fewer stochastic disease events, and the desirable tourist segment was predicted to predominate. By understanding how management will affect tourist activities and their subsequent impacts on both wildlife health and visitor satisfaction, one can explore the management alternatives that would optimize both. © 2010 Elsevier B.V.",Human-wildlife interactions | Integrative modelling | Stingray | System dynamics | Tourism management | Wildlife ecology,17,0,FQRNT,undefined,Fonds Québécois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies

Here, we explore these issues in the highly invasive vase tunicate, Ciona intestinalis, a species whose invasion history has been obscured by its poorly understood taxonomy and population genetics. Recent phylogenetic and comparative genomic studies suggest that C.intestinalis is a cryptic species complex consisting of at least three species. We reconstructed phylogenies based on both mitochondrial (cytochrome c oxidase subunit 3-NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 region and NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 gene) and nuclear (internal transcribed spacer 1) sequences, results of which support four major phylogroups corresponding to the previously reported spA, spB and Ciona spp. (spC) as well as an undescribed cryptic species (spD). While spC and spD remain restricted to their native ranges in the Mediterranean Sea and Black Sea, respectively, the highly invasive species (spA and spB) have disjunct global distributions. Despite extensive interspecific divergences, we identified low phylogeographical structure within these two invasive species. Haplotype network analyses revealed comparatively limited mutation steps among haplotypes within each species. Population genetic analyses based on two mtDNA fragments and eight unlinked microsatellites illustrated relatively low population differentiation and high population connectivity at both regional and continental scales in the two invasive species. Human-mediated dispersal coupled with a high potential for natural dispersal is probably responsible for the observed genetic homogeneity. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",ascidian | biological invasion | cryptic speciation | gene flow | genetic differentiation | population connectivity,100,0,,undefined,

Mid-ocean exchange and saltwater flushing were implemented as management practices to reduce the likelihood of new biological invasions in the Laurentian Great Lakes associated with ships' ballast water and sediments. Despite this, there has been no formal assessment of the efficacy of these procedures. Here, we conduct a comparative analysis of community composition of dormant taxa transported by ballast sediment before and after regulations came into effect in 2006.2. Ballast sediment samples were collected from 17 ships during the post-regulation interval of 2007 and 2008. Invertebrate eggs were counted, hatched and species identified in the laboratory. Results were compared to similar samples collected from 39 ships between 2000 and 2002, prior to implementation of saltwater flushing regulations.3. The estimated amount of residual ballast sediment transported by vessels was significantly lower during the post-regulation period, ranging from <1 to 45 tonnes per ship, with an average of 5 tonnes. Mean density and number of dormant viable eggs per ship declined 91 and 81%, respectively.4. Community composition also changed through time, with Rotifera accounting for 78% of taxa transported prior to regulation, whereas Cladocera and Copepoda each accounted for 38% of abundance post-regulation. Although the number of non-indigenous species (NIS) declined 73% per ship after 2006, the reduction was not statistically significant; however, the number of freshwater NIS - which pose the greatest risk of invasion for the Great Lakes - was significantly lowered.5. Our comparative analysis suggests that ballast management regulations enacted in 2006 markedly reduced the probability of introduction of NIS via dormant eggs carried in ballast sediments. © 2010 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Ballast sediment | Biological invasions | Dormant eggs | Non-indigenous species | Saltwater flushing,29,0,,undefined,

Using an Acoustic Location System, we examined the dawn chorus singing behaviour of male black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) in 15 neighbourhoods to determine whether singing behaviour is consistent with the communication network model. We calculated levels of frequency matching for 19 focal males and all of their neighbours. The observed level of frequency matching was greater than expected by chance. All males were involved in multi-way matching at dawn and often matched two or three neighbours simultaneously. The identity of individuals involved in three-way matches was related to both previous winter-flock membership and the relative dominance rank of the interacting males. We show that male black-capped chickadee dawn choruses are interactive communication networks where males are involved in high levels of matching with neighbours, and they match multiple individuals both simultaneously and sequentially. Additionally, the existence of multi-way matching and the identities of individuals involved suggest that individual males may eavesdrop at dawn.

Most of these neurons either had low level of firing or generated no action potentials in the absence of sound stimulation. In response to tone bursts, about half of the ICd neurons fired at the onset while about 40% of the neurons fired over the entire duration of the sounds. The remaining ICd neurons fired transiently at the offset or both the onset and the offset of the sounds. In comparison with neurons in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, neurons in the ICd had much longer first spike latencies and much larger magnitudes of jitter in the first spike latency. Many neurons in the ICd displayed complex frequency tuning properties. No strong correlation was revealed between the characteristic frequency of a neuron and its location along an axis oriented from a rostrodorsolateral to a caudoventromedial part of the ICd. There are neurons in the ICd showing stimulus-specific adaptation. For these neurons, presentations of a tone burst elicited stronger responses when these presentations were embedded in a train of tone bursts with various different frequencies than clustered in a block. Neurons with stimulus-specific adaptation displayed phasic firing at the onset of a tone burst.

Excitatory/inhibitory binaural interactions and interaural-level difference curves were determined for responses to 100 ms dichotic tone bursts presented to the left and right ears simultaneously. Most neurons with sustained responses to tone bursts had the same binaural response type throughout the 100 ms stimulus period. However, some neurons (39% of our sample) showed qualitatively different binaural response types during the early and late parts of the stimulus (the first 20 ms versus the last 80 ms of the tone burst). Also, for many neurons with consistent early and late binaural response patterns, the strength of binaural interaction was different during the early and late periods. For example, for neurons excited by the contralateral ear and inhibited by the ipsilateral ear during the entire 100 ms period (the most common binaural response type), the degree of inhibition was generally greater during the later part of a stimulus. This change in the strength and/or quality of binaural interaction during dichotic stimulation likely reflects a complex pattern of converging excitatory and inhibitory inputs to the inferior colliculus from lower brainstem structures as well as the time course of local synaptic events.

This study investigated the effects of wetlands formed with oil sands tailings materials on the survival and growth of wood frog (Rana sylvatica) larvae.

PCB congener ktot values determined for koi were representative of those generated for fish species of similar size and reared at near optimal temperatures. For persistent and metabolized-type PCB congeners, no significant difference was observed between the regressions describing the relationships between ktot and log Kow for these congeners. Individual PCB congener keg coefficient estimates ranged between 1% and 20% of their respective k tot values but averaged only 5% of the magnitude of ktot over a log Kow range of 5.7-7.8. These results verify first-order kinetics of PCB elimination by a fish species and demonstrate that the relative contribution of keg to ktot is negligible, even for highly hydrophobic (log Kow > 6.5) compounds.

They are often monitored by acoustic surveys, yet Barred Owl vocalizations and vocal behavior are poorly described. We present a detailed analysis of Barred Owl vocal behavior with four goals: (1) to provide a quantitative description of Barred Owl vocalizations, including those given within duets, (2) to examine diel variation in vocal output for multiple vocalizations, (3) to explore the use of vocalizations inside and outside of duets, and (4) to identify sex-specific vocal characteristics and discuss their utility in identifying an owl's sex. Adult Barred Owls produced 13 distinct vocalizations that could be assigned to call type on the basis of fine-structural measurements. Barred Owls vocalized throughout the day but were more vocal at night with peaks in vocal activity from 18:00 to 20:00 and 02:00 to 05:00. Most calls were produced throughout the night, but some (e.g., alarm calls) were more common at particular times. Two types of vocalizations were produced only within duets, and one type of vocalization occurred primarily outside duets. Calls of females were higher in pitch with longer terminal notes and more vibrato than those of males. Using these differences, cluster analysis assigned owls to two groups corresponding to predicted sex with 91% accuracy. We discuss possible functions of certain vocalizations and how understanding the vocal repertoire and sex differences of this species' acoustic signals will benefit behavioral studies and monitoring, including Spotted Owl (Strix occidentalis) conservation. © The Cooper Ornithological Society 2010.",Barred Owl | Behavior | Duet | Strix varia | Vocalizations,21,0,,undefined,

Over the past 10 years, there have been repeated calls to tighten up basic assumptions when applying stable isotopes, one of the most important being the application of accurate, species-specific diet-tissue discrimination factors (DTDFs). Taxa- or species-specific DTDFs are required for (i) predicting dietary sources to a consumer using stable isotope mixing models and (ii) for estimating trophic position relative to primary consumers or known base species. Logan & Lutcavage (2010) recently presented data on stable isotope dynamics in elasmobranch fishes and concluded that DTDFs for teleost fish were suitable for elasmobranch fish, endorsing the generally applied value of 3.4‰. When considering (i) a recent study which found that DTDFs were lower for large sharks than teleost fish (Hussey et al., 2010) and (ii) that the Logan and Lutcavage study did not experimentally address the issue of DTDFs, we would argue that this conclusion is misleading. We demonstrate this point by estimating the proportion of prey items of a captive shark with a known diet history by modelling the δ15N values of the shark and its prey. The often repeated implication of inaccurate DTDFs is clear, with model results highly variable depending on the selected DTDF. In addition, model results for the standard teleost DTDF of 3.4‰ provided erroneous estimates of prey consumption. The suggestion that DTDFs for teleost fish are suitable for elasmobranchs may mislead investigators to choose DTDFs which are likely not applicable to their study species. Caution is therefore warranted in advocating this approach. Continued experimental work to examine stable isotopes in sharks is required and recommendations are made. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Diet-tissue discrimination factor | Elasmobranch | Fractionation | Mixing model | Shark | Stable isotopes | Trophic position,31,0,,undefined,

Timing requires both the ability to accurately interpret the appropriate environmental cues, and the flexibility to respond to inter-annual variation in these cues. Determining which cues are linked to reproductive timing, what these cues are predicting and understanding the fitness consequences of variation in timing, is therefore of paramount interest to evolutionary and applied ecologists, especially in the face of global climate change. We investigated inter-annual relationships between climatic variation and the timing of reproduction in Canada's largest breeding population of Arctic common eiders (Somateria mollissima) in East Bay, Nunavut. Warmer spring temperatures predicted both earlier mean annual laying dates and the earlier ice-free conditions required by ducklings for post-natal growth. Warmer springs had higher variation in this temperature cue, and the population laying distribution became increasingly positively-skewed in warmer summers, potentially indicating that more low quality females had the opportunity to commence laying in warmer years. Females that timed laying to match duckling hatching just prior to fully ice-free conditions obtained the highest duckling survival probability. Inter-annual data on repeated breeding attempts revealed that the individuals examined show a similar degree of laying flexibility in response to climatic variation; however, there was significant individual variation in the absolute timing of laying within an average year. This work sheds light on how reproductive timing is related to and influenced by variation in local climate and provides vital information on how climate-related variation in reproductive timing influence a fitness measure in an Arctic species. Results are especially relevant to future work in polar environments given that global climatic changes are predicted to be most intense at high latitudes. © 2010 Springer-Verlag.",Climatic variability | Common eider (Somateria mollissima) | Offspring survival | Temperature cue | Timing of breeding,47,0,FQRNT,undefined,Fonds Québécois de la Recherche sur la Nature et les Technologies

Playback is a valuable technique for exploring vocal duetting behavior because it allows investigators to test predictions of the various hypotheses for duet function. Here, we adopt a methodological perspective by considering various challenges specific to studying duetting behavior, and highlighting the utility of different playback designs for testing duet function. Single-speaker playback experiments allow investigators to determine how duetting birds react to different stimuli, but do not simulate duets in a spatially realistic manner. Multi-speaker playback experiments are superior to single-speaker designs because duet stimuli are broadcast with spatial realism and unique and additional predictions can be generated for testing duet function. In particular, multi-speaker playback allows investigators to evaluate how birds respond to male versus female duet contributions separately, based on reactions to the different loudspeakers. Interactive playback allows investigators to ask questions about the time- and pattern-specific singing behavior of birds, and to understand how singing strategies correspond to physical behavior during vocal interactions. Although logistically challenging, interactive playback provides a powerful tool for examining specific elements of duets (such as the degree of coordination) and may permit greater insight into their functions from an operational perspective. Interactive playback designs where the investigator simulates half of a duet may be used to describe and investigate the function of pair-specific and population-wide duet codes. Regardless of experimental design, all playback experiments should be based on a sound understanding of the natural duetting behavior of the species of interest, and should aim to produce realistic and carefully controlled duet simulations. Future studies that couple playback techniques with other experimental procedures, such as Acoustic Location System recordings for monitoring the position of birds in dense vegetation or multimodal techniques that combine acoustic with visual stimuli, are expected to provide an even better understanding of these highly complex vocal displays. ©2010 The Author(s).

However, the factors influencing hyporheic bacterial communities along spatial and seasonal gradients remain poorly understood. We sought to characterize patterns in bacterial community composition among the sediments of a small stream in southern Ontario, Canada. We used sampling cores to collect monthly hyporheic water and sediment microbial communities in 2006 and 2007. We described bacterial communities terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) and tested for spatial and seasonal relationships with physicochemical parameters using multivariate statistics. Overall, the hyporheic zone appears to be a DOC, oxygen, and nitrogen sink. Microbial communities were distinct from those at the streambed surface and from soil collected in the adjacent watershed. In the sediments, microbial communities were distinct between the fall, spring, and summer seasons, and bacterial communities were more diverse at streambed surface and near-surface sites compared with deeper sites. Moreover, bacterial communities were similar between consecutive fall seasons despite shifting throughout the year, suggesting recurring community assemblages associated with season and location in the hyporheic zone. Using canonical correspondence analysis, seasonal patterns in microbial community composition and environmental parameters were correlated in the following way: temperature was related to summer communities; DOC (likely from biofilm and allochthonous inputs) influenced most fall communities; and nitrogen associated strongly with winter and spring communities. Our results also suggest that labile DOC entering the hyporheic zone occurred in concert with shifts in the bacterial community.

In particular, predation has been implicated as a major force affecting female sexual preferences, male mating tactics and the level of sperm competition. When predation is high, females typically reduce their preferences for showy males and engage more in antipredator behaviours, whereas males exploit these changes by switching from sexual displays to forced matings. These patterns are thought to account for the relatively high levels of multiple paternity in high-predation populations compared to low-predation populations. Here, we assess the possible evolutionary consequences of these patterns by asking whether variation in sperm traits reflect differences in predation intensity among four pairs of Trinidadian populations: four that experience relatively low levels of predation from a gape-limited predator and four that experience relatively high levels of predation from a variety of piscivores. We found that males in high-predation populations had faster swimming sperm with longer midpieces compared to males in low-predation populations. However, we found no differences among males in high- and low-predation populations with respect to sperm number, sperm head length, flagellum length and total sperm length. © 2010 The Authors.

Here, we investigate variation in the colorful traits of bluegills, Lepomis macrochirus, to elucidate their possible function. Bluegills use alternative mating tactics whereby males develop into one of two irreversible phenotypes termed parental and cuckolder. Parentals build and defend nests and care for offspring whereas cuckolders obtain matings by sneaking copulations. We hypothesized that bluegill coloration might function as a sexual ornament in parental males and that ornamental coloration might serve as an honest indicator of male quality. We predicted that coloration should be more pronounced in parental males than in females and immature males and should be more pronounced during the breeding season. We also predicted that males in better condition should be more intensely colored than fish in poor condition. To test our predictions, we sampled 510 bluegills during the breeding and post-breeding seasons at nine lakes in southern Ontario, Canada, in 2007. We used reflectance spectrometry to quantify the coloration of five body regions, aged and sexed each fish, and calculated Fulton's condition factor from morphological measurements. A separate experiment showed that color did not fade several minutes post capture, suggesting that coloration could be measured reliably and consistently. We found that color was influenced by maturity, sex, and season, in the predicted direction, for three body regions (breast, cheek, and opercular flap). We also found that color varied with the condition of males such that males in better condition were darker for the sexually dichromatic ventral and facial regions. Our findings therefore suggest that some colorful traits in bluegills may serve as condition-dependent sexual signals during the breeding season. Our research contributes to a growing appreciation of the importance of visual signaling in aquatic environments. © 2010 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,9,0,,undefined,

Consequently, patterns of MHC genetic variation should reflect selection pressures across the landscape. We examined genetic variation and population genetic structure at the MHC class I-A1 and class II-B1 exons in five Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) populations from two geographic regions in British Columbia, Canada. We then compared estimates of population structure at the MHC genes with neutral estimates based on microsatellites to examine the potential for local adaptation at the MHC. Chinook salmon are in decline throughout much of their native range and understanding the degree of local adaptation exhibited by the MHC may be important in conservation planning. Comparisons among populations yielded higher G′ ST estimates for the MHC class I than expected under neutrality based on the microsatellites. In contrast, the MHC class II tended to exhibit lower G′ ST values than did the microsatellites. These results suggest that across populations unique selection pressures are driving allele frequency differences at the MHC class I but that the MHC class II may be the subject of homogenizing selection. Rates of nonsynonymous versus synonymous substitutions found in codons associated within the MHC class I and II peptide-binding regions provided strong evidence of positive selection. Together, these results support the hypothesis that selection is influencing genetic variation at the MHC, but suggest that selection pressures may vary at the two classes of loci both at the sequence and population levels. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.",Chinook salmon | Local adaptation | Major histocompatibility complex | Population genetic structure | Selection,26,1,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Two of the diets were naturally contaminated and were obtained by collecting mayflies from Lake Erie (ON, Canada) and emerald shiners from the Detroit River (MI, USA). The remaining diets consisted of commercial fish pellets (lipid contents from 6.7 to 24%) that were contaminated by spiking with a PCB mixture. Experimental fish were held individually to quantify the amount of food consumed per fish and, following a 48-h fasting period to facilitate food digestion and assimilation; AEs were determined by mass balance. Fish fed the benthic invertebrate food exhibited the highest PCB AEs (70-101%) and were significantly elevated compared to the other diet treatments (AEs ranging from 23 to 87%). The PCB AEs for fish fed emerald shiners did not differ from those fed pellet formulations. Variation among PCB AEs was not related to diet lipid content. For all diet treatments, PCB AEs were significantly related to chemical hydrophobicity. The relationship between chemical AE and n-octanol/water partition coefficient (KOW) was best explained by a linear model compared to a two-phase resistance model. Overall, PCB AEs were observed to be dependent on both diet type and chemical hydrophobicity, with both factors contributing nearly equally to the variation measured in this toxicokinetic parameter. © 2009 SETAC.",Absorption efficiency | Bioaccumulation | Persistent organic pollutants | Toxicokinetics,19,0,,undefined,

Specifically, we combined microsatellite genotyping of DNA from feces for individual identification with fecal contaminant analyses to evaluate exposure of 23 wild otters to organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and polybrominated diphenylethers (PBDEs). Overall, feces collected from otters in urban/industrial Victoria Harbor had the greatest concentrations of nearly all compounds assessed. Fecal concentrations of OCPs and PBDEs were generally low throughout the region, whereas PCBs dominated in all locations. Re-sampling of known otters over space and time revealed that PCB exposure varied with movement and landscape use. Otters with the highest fecal PCB concentrations were those inhabiting the inner reaches of Victoria Harbor and adjacent Esquimalt Harbor, and those venturing into the harbor systems. Over 50% of samples collected from eight known otters in Victoria Harbor had total-PCB concentrations above the maximum allowable concentration as established for Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra) feces, with a geometric mean value (10.6 mg/kg lipid wt) that exceeded the reproductive toxicity threshold (9 mg/kg lipid wt). Those results are consistent with our findings from 1998 and 2004, and indicate that the harbors of southern Vancouver Island, particularly Victoria Harbor, are a chronic source of PCB exposure for otters. The present study further demonstrates the suitability of using otter feces as a noninvasive/destructive biomonitoring tool in contaminant studies, particularly when sampling of the same individuals at the local population-level is desired. © 2009 SETAC.",Feces | Georgia Basin | Lontra canadensis | Noninvasive monitoring | Polyhalogenated aromatic hydrocarbons,26,0,,undefined,

(2) Do owls discriminate between duets of neighbours versus strangers? (3) Do duets play a role in extended communication among a neighbourhood of owls? We simulated territorial encounters by broadcasting duets of adjacent, territory-holding owls (neighbours) and distant owls (strangers). We assessed responses to playback using a 3.5-km transect of automated recording devices. We compared vocal activity during a pre-playback period and following both playback treatments for the focal pair, their neighbours, and more distant owls within the neighbourhood. After playback, focal owls gave significantly more duets, vocalized for a longer duration, and emphasized different call types compared to the pre-playback period, demonstrating that barred owls use duets in territory defence. Focal owls did not respond significantly differently to neighbours versus strangers. At the neighbourhood level, owls did not behave differently during silent pre-playback periods or post-playback periods.

However, at depth, catchment groundwater is linked to channel water via the hyporheic zone. Complex hydrological interactions between these two water masses in the hyporheic zone, combined with biogeochemical processes, produce a set of physicochemical conditions that support the hyporheos - a community of invertebrates and microorganisms. There is evidence that the hyporheos contains unique elements, but also some that indicates transition to benthic communities and processes above, and to those of true groundwater below. While some aspects of these communities are becoming known, for example their composition is influenced by depth-related variables and interstitial water temperature, many others, such as the response of bacteria to different sources and concentrations of DOC and nitrogen, and whether protists provide a trophic link between microorganism and invertebrates, are still poorly understood. Drawing on historical and new knowledge revealed by a variety of contemporary techniques for characterizing interstitial water and its inhabitants, this paper will attempt to address some of these uncertainties and also, formally, examine the candidacy of the hyporheic zone as an ecotone. © 2010 E.

We observed spawning activities of 76 parental males in Lake Opinicon, Ontario. We captured each male and used reflectance spectrometry to objectively quantify the colour of six body regions and measured morphological characteristics. Our results show that female spawning behaviours did not significantly differ between central and peripheral males, although egg scores were higher in central nests. During spawning, females appeared to enter the nests of parental males haphazardly. However, our results suggest that male cheek colouration influenced the number of females spawning, the number of eggs they released, and the amount of time they spent in the nest. Moreover, male breast colouration significantly predicted reproductive success as quantified through egg scores.

However, sexual conflict may interfere with female preference when males attempt to mate with all females, regardless of compatibility. Here we used semi-natural spawning channels to examine how mating behaviour and genetic similarity at the MHC class II peptide binding region affected parentage patterns in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We found that females directed aggression at more MHC-similar males than expected by chance, providing a possible mechanism of female MHC choice in salmon. Males also directed aggression towards MHC-similar females, which was consistent with males harassing unreceptive mates. Males' aggression was positively correlated with their reproductive success, and it appeared to overcome female aversion to mating with MHC-similar males, as females who were the target of high levels of male aggression had lower than expected MHC divergence in their offspring. Indeed, offspring MHC divergence was highest when the sex ratio was female-biased and male harassment was likely to be less intense. These data suggest that male harassment can reduce female effectiveness in selecting MHC-compatible mates, and sexual conflict can thus have an indirect cost to females. © 2009 The Royal Society.",Coercive mating | Major histocompatibility complex | Mate choice | Salmonids | Sexual selection,31,1,,undefined,

These gradients persist over seasons, decades, and possibly centuries. Under these nearly steady-state conditions, vertical eddy diffusion coefficients (Kz) cannot be estimated by conventional methods that rely on time derivatives of temperature distributions. We use and compare several alternative methods: one-dimensional k-ε, modeling, three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling, correlation with the size of Thorpe instabilities, and correlation with the stability frequency. In the thermocline region, at 100-m depth, the Kz is ∼ 5 × 10-6 m2 s-1, but, below 300 m, the small density gradient results in large (20 m) vertical eddies and high mixing rates (Kz ∼ 10-2 m2 s-1). The estimated timescale of water renewal in the monimolimnion is several hundred years. Intense evaporation depletes the surface mixed layer of 16O and 1H isotopes, making it isotopically heavier. The lake waters become progressively isotopically lighter with depth, and the isotopic composition in the deep waters is close to those of the ground and tributary waters. The vertical distribution of Kz is used in a biogeochemical reaction-transport model. We show that, outside of a narrow thermocline region, the vertical distributions of dissolved oxygen, iron, methane, and phosphorus are shaped by vertical variations in transport rates, rather than by sources or sinks. © 2010, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,28,0,,undefined,

However, shoreline geography and oceanographic currents can modify the dispersal pattern of pelagic larvae. On Vancouver Island (VI), British Columbia, 3 species of blue mussels (native Mytilus trossulus and introduced M. galloprovincialis and M. edulis) form a localized hybrid zone. Here we genetically mapped the distribution of Mytilus species and populations along VI and the surrounding islands. Using diagnostic species markers and microsatellite loci, we estimated the extent of the Mytilus hybrid zone on VI and measured population differentiation among the observed sites in 2005 and 2006. We predicted that the distribution of non-native genotypes would be mirrored by the microsatellite allelic patterns, which correspond to oceanographic features that reflect barriers to gene flow in the Strait of Georgia. Generally, non-native genotypes were restricted to southern VI and strong microsatellite population structure was detected. The distribution of non-native genotypes reflected patterns of microsatellite allele frequency in the Strait of Georgia. Using a landscape genetics approach, we identified 2 genetic discontinuities, which correspond to oceanographic and hydrographic features of the Strait of Georgia. Thus, physical dispersal barriers likely limit the spread of the VI Mytilus hybrid zone; however, additional biological barriers to dispersal must also exist. The VI Mytilus hybrid zone provides an excellent example of complex dispersal patterns in a non-equilibrium system. © 2010 Inter-Research.",Distribution | Gene flow barriers | Hybrid | Hybrid zone maintenance | Landscape genetics | Microsatellite | Mytilus,8,1,,undefined,

It is evident that the diversity and complexity of organisms are not dependent solely on their number of genes, but also the variability in gene expression and gene interactions. Furthermore, slight differences in transcription control can fundamentally affect the fitness of the organism in a variable environment or during development. In this study, triploid and diploid Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) were used to examine the effects of polyploidy on specific and genome-wide gene expression response using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) and microarray technology after an immune challenge with the pathogen Vibrio anguillarum. Although triploid and diploid fish had significant differences in mortality, qRT-PCR revealed no differences in cytokine gene expression response (interleukin-8, interleukin-1, interleukin-8 receptor and tumor necrosis factor), whereas differences were observed in constitutively expressed genes, (immunoglobulin (Ig) M, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) -II and β-actin) upon live Vibrio anguillarum exposure. Genome-wide microarray analysis revealed that, overall, triploid gene expression is similar to diploids, consistent with their similar phenotypes. This pattern, however, can subtly be altered under stress (for example, handling, V. anguillarum challenge) as we have observed at some housekeeping genes. Our results are the first report of dosage effect on gene transcription in a vertebrate, and they support the observation that diploid and triploid salmon are generally phenotypically indistinguishable, except under stress, when triploids show reduced performance. © 2010 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

Although ballast water exchange (BWE) is effective for live fresh-water animals, laboratory experiments provide mixed results with regards to its impact on diapausing zooplankton eggs. We conducted an in situ test of the effectiveness of BWE for treating diapausing eggs in ballast sediments. Incubation chambers containing ballast sediment were placed in ballast tanks of cargo vessels transiting from North America to Europe. Each vessel had paired ballast tanks, one of which remained filled with Great Lakes water (control), while the second was exchanged with mid-ocean water. Laboratory viability tests were then conducted to compare viability of eggs recovered from sediments placed in both treatments, as well as identical sediments that remained at the laboratory in cold storage. No significant differences in egg viability were detected between treatments, but more species hatched from sediment that remained in cold storage. Results indicate that physical conditions in ballast tanks may affect egg viability, but saltwater exposure does not eliminate the risk of species introductions via diapausing eggs. Strategies that minimize sediment accumulation in ballast tanks can reduce the risk of species introductions via diapausing eggs.",,10,0,,undefined,

Few F1 hybrids were found, and genotype frequencies suggest strong backcrossing of hybrids to pure parental populations at both ends of the gradient. The increasing prevalence of RT alleles downstream is accompanied by a life history gradient such that RT alleles were positively associated with growth rate and negatively associated with survivorship. Although physical barriers extended the distribution of pure WCT downstream, several streams held genetically pure WCT in their uppermost reaches, even when no barriers were present. For example, RT alleles were undetectable in headwaters of Dutch Creek, which had no barriers but was very cold (average summer temperature <7.3 °C). We propose that RT alleles affect the choice of habitat, as well the metabolic characteristics that determine their life history and competitive abilities. Factors such as climate change, clear-cut logging, and anthropogenic enrichment that can lead to increased temperature and (or) productivity might be expected to result in an upstream shift of RT alleles.",,29,0,,undefined,

Here, the auditory abilities of settlement-stage larvae of four species of coral reef fishes (families Pomacentridae, Lutjanidae and Serranidae) and similar-sized individuals of two pelagic species (Carangidae) were tested using an electrophysiological technique, auditory brainstem response (ABR). Five of the six species heard frequencies in the 100-2,000 Hz range, whilst one carangid species did not detect frequencies higher than 800 Hz. The audiograms of the six species were of similar shape, with best hearing at lower frequencies between 100 and 300 Hz. Strong within-species differences were found in hearing sensitivity both among the coral reef species and among the pelagic species. Larvae of the coral reef species had significantly more sensitive hearing than the larvae of the pelagic species. The results suggest that settlement-stage larval reef fishes may be able to detect reef sounds at distances of a few 100 m. If true hearing thresholds are lower than ABR estimates, as indicated in some comparisons of ABR and behavioural methods, the detection distances would be much larger. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Auditory brainstem response | Coral reef fish | Larvae | Settlement-stage,33,0,,DP0345876,Australian Research Council

Results indicate that Lakers transported at least 68 million tonnes of ballast water annually. Approximately 71% of ballast water transfers were interregional, with net movement being from lower to upper lakes. A small proportion of ballast water discharged in the Great Lakes (<1%) originated from ports in the St. Lawrence River that may serve as sources for new NIS.

For example, discriminating among signallers allows receivers to ignore unreliable individuals or to focus their territorial defence on unfamiliar intruders. Such discrimination requires signals to be individually distinctive; that is, signals must vary more among than within individuals. Furthermore, receivers must be able to discriminate among the signals of different individuals. In this study, we used fine structural analysis to show that the simple songs of male blackcapped chickadees are individually distinctive, but that substantial variation exists both within and among recordings of the same individual. This finding emphasizes the need for multiple recordings of each individual in studies of individual distinctiveness, since failing to measure variation across recordings of the same individual can make it difficult to determine whether signals vary among individuals or whether they simply vary among different recording sessions. To test whether chickadees discriminate among the signals of different individuals, we used a playback experiment in which we broadcast priming and discrimination stimuli to 45 territorial males. When individuals heard the playback of two different males, they produced more songs and remained near the loudspeaker for a longer period than when they heard two different exemplars from the same male. Chickadees can therefore discriminate among singers based exclusively on their songs, which may help to explain how chickadees eavesdrop on singing contests and subsequently select extrapair mates on the basis of song contest performance. © 2010 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Predator-prey interactions define the majority of trophic interactions and food web dynamics, and visual analysis of stomach, gut or fecal content composition is the technique traditionally used to quantify predator-prey interactions. Unfortunately such techniques may be biased and inaccurate due to variation in digestion rates (Sheppard & Hardwood 2005); however, those limitations can be largely overcome with new technology. In the last 20 years, the use of molecular genetic techniques in ecology has exploded (King et al. 2008). The growing availability of molecular genetic methods and data has fostered the use of PCR-based techniques to accurately distinguish and identify prey items in stomach, gut and fecal samples.

We aimed to establish the complement of NIS transported via this vector to the Great Lakes and to determine if they pose an invasion risk. Location Laurentian Great Lakes. Methods During 2007 and 2008, we collected scrapings from exterior surfaces as well as underwater video-transects from 20 vessels shortly after their arrival in Great Lakes' ports. Invertebrates present were sorted and identified in the laboratory. Results Total estimated abundance averaged > 170,000 invertebrates per ship belonging to 109 taxa. Most (72%) of these taxa were freshwater species already present in the Great Lakes, whereas 11 and 31% were native to estuarine and marine habitats respectively, and would not be expected to survive in this habitat. Abundance was dominated by barnacles (51%), cladocerans (19%), bivalves (12%) and amphipods (11%). Sea-chest grating and the rudder were hot-spots for biofouling. Invertebrate diversity and total abundance were positively associated with total time spent in port during the last year and time in Pacific South American ports and negatively related to time in high latitudes and sailing speed. Although we found some live, established invaders such as Gammarus tigrinus and Dreissena rostriformis bugensis, only one individual of a freshwater NIS (Alexandrovia onegensis, Oligochaeta) not yet reported in the Great Lakes was detected. The animal's poor condition and seemingly low population abundance indicated the risk of live introduction by this vector was likely quite low. Main conclusion Our results indicate that hull fouling appears to pose a low risk of introductions of new species capable of surviving in the Great Lakes, unlike foreign-sourced freshwater ballast water that historically was discharged by these transoceanic vessels. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Biological invasions | Great Lakes | Hull fouling | Invasion vectors | Non-indigenous species | Ships,37,0,,undefined,

The breakdown of reproductive isolation is of concern to managers, and raises the question: how have the two species retained their genetic and morphological divergence? Using a combination of mitochondrial DNA and nuclear DNA markers coupled with watershed attribute and disturbance data, we determined the distribution and frequency of trout hybridization on Vancouver Island, BC and the environmental factors associated with the hybridization. We found 284 hybrids (among 1004 fish) in 29 of 36 sampled populations. High variation in levels of hybridization was observed among populations, and no single environmental factor was found to dominate in determining hybridization levels. However, logging activity, urban infrastructure development, and stocking of hatchery rainbow trout played significant roles in determining hybridization levels, and populations in small watersheds are more at risk of reproductive barrier breakdown. This study illustrates that cutthroat-rainbow trout reproductive barrier breakdown is widespread on Vancouver Island and that anthropogenic disturbance plays a role in the process. As similar environmental disturbance is common in much of coastal trout habitat, large-scale hybridization may be occurring elsewhere and thus may represent a critical management issue for Pacific trout species. © 2009 The Authors.

Rapid digestion rates probably explain why fish larvae are rarely found in stomach contents, yet quantification of digestion rates of fish larvae is generally lacking, especially in freshwater systems. Using a series of laboratory experiments, we quantified the effects of temperature and larval fish (prey) size on digestion rate. We also evaluated whether species type (both predator and prey) influences digestion rate and described the morphological breakdown of fish larvae during digestion. Bluegills Lepomis macrochirus and yellow perch Perca flavescens were force-fed the larvae of guppies Poecilia spp., rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss, and yellow perch at a range of temperatures (7-22°C), and digestion rates were measured using prey mass before and after digestion (i.e., proportional loss of prey mass after ingestion). As expected, digestion rates increased with water temperature and decreased with prey body mass but were unaffected by species of predator. A confounding effect of prey type (fresh versus frozen) prevented a thorough evaluation of prey species, although yellow perch and rainbow trout (both previously flash-frozen) were digested at similar rates. The complete breakdown of larvae in predator stomachs and the loss of morphological characters needed to identify larvae occurred rapidly, confirming the challenges of evaluating predation mortality based on stomach contents of field-collected predators. Ultimately, our findings can be used to help researchers quantify the likelihood of detecting larval fish in the stomachs of field-caught predators when using conventional stomach content analyses. © 2010 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,35,0,,undefined,

Until recently, efforts to manage this vector have overlooked the potential transport of invertebrate resting stages in the residual waters and sediments within emptied ballast tanks, i.e. NOBOB ('No Ballast On Board') tanks. The resting stages (statoblasts) of freshwater bryozoans are often buoyant and locally abundant and thus can be taken up easily during ballasting operations. They are also resistant to extreme environmental conditions and can generate new colonies after being dormant for decades; as such, they would likely remain viable propagules after lengthy transport in ship ballast tanks. This study quantified the occurrence of freshwater bryozoan statoblasts in ballast tank sediments of transoceanic ships. Location North American Great Lakes. Methods We quantified the frequency of occurrence, abundance and diversity of bryozoans (as statoblasts) in residual sediment samples taken from 51 NOBOB tanks of 33 transoceanic ships visiting the Great Lakes from 2000 to 2002. Results Our study identified 11 species, comprising nearly 12% of the total number of freshwater bryozoans known worldwide. These include two exotic species unrecorded in the Great Lakes (Fredericella sultana and Lophopus crystallinus), an exotic species already established in the region (Lophopodella carteri) and three cosmopolitan species (Plumatella casmiana, P. fungosa and P. repens). Our estimates suggest that a ship with NOBOB tanks may carry up to 106 statoblasts. Main conclusions The discovery of species unrecorded in the Great Lakes and the potentially large numbers of statoblasts being transported in ship ballast tanks indicate a significant risk of new species introductions. Furthermore, the presence of cosmopolitan species and an exotic species already established in the Great Lakes suggests the strong possibility of cryptic invasions via the introduction of exotic genotypes. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Bryozoa | Great Lakes | Invasive species | Propagule pressure | Ship ballast tanks | Statoblasts,17,0,,undefined,

Life-history theory predicts that organisms will provide an optimal level of parental investment for offspring survival balanced against the effects on their own survival and future reproductive potential. 2. Optimal resource allocation models also predict an increase in reproductive output with age as expected future reproductive effort decreases. To date, maternal investment in sharks has received limited attention. 3. We found that neonatal dusky sharks (Carcharhinus obscurus) are not independent from maternal resource allocation at the point of parturition but instead are provisioned with energy reserves in the form of an enlarged liver that constitutes approximately 20% of total body mass. 4. Analysis of long-term archived data sets showed that a large proportion of this enlarged liver is utilized during the first weeks or months of life suggesting that the reported weight loss of newborn sharks signifies a natural orientation process and is not necessarily related to prey abundance and/or indicative of high mortality rates. 5. Interrogation of near-term pup mass in two carcharhinids, the dusky and spinner shark (Carcharhinus brevipinna), further revealed an increase in reproductive output with maternal size, with evidence for a moderate decline in the largest mothers. 6. For the dusky shark, there was a trade-off between increasing litter size and near-term pup mass in support of optimal offspring size theory. 7. For both the dusky and spinner shark, there was a linear increase in near-term pup mass with month, which may indicate variable parturition strategies and/or that carcharhinids are able to adjust the length of the gestation period. 8.

We find that in this system, the short-term dispersal of these insects is described well by our individual-based model, but can also be described by a 2D grid-based biased random walk model when mortality is accounted for. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

For bluegill, lipid normalized concentrations of PCB congeners of log Kow < 6.8 did not demonstrate any significant increases across individuals 2-5 years of age. In similarly aged cisco, however, significant age-related increases in lipid normalized PCB concentrations were observed for the majority of these congeners. For PCBs of log Kow > 6.8, these congeners demonstrated significant and similar age-related fugacity increases in both species. These patterns indicated that the bioaccumulation of less hydrophobic PCB congeners in bluegill suggest quicker growth kinetics and demonstrate the potential of this species to achieve steady state within their lifetime. In contrast, PCB bioaccumulation patterns in cisco demonstrated that biomagnification and non-steady state kinetics better reflect the capacity of this species to bioaccumulate PCBs. These results demonstrated that for pollutants of log Kow < 6.8, growth dilution and age-specific metabolic rates are critical for understanding their bioaccumulation by freshwater fish.

Superficially, their communities are known to include bacteria, protists, algae, fungi, higher plants, and invertebrate and vertebrate animals that come together to benefit from the rich resources and oftentimes relatively predator-free space that these habitats provide. The cost of these benefits requires adaptation to a highly variable, though often predictable, hydroperiod. This chapter will focus on wetland habitats that are truly intermittent in their water-balance, and will summarize what is known of the structure of the biota at different trophic levels and how they interact at a dynamic land/water interface. For example, fluctuations in flooding regime are known to cause fluxes in carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in basin sediments as well as in the water column. Such nutrient pulses can lead to increased productivity followed by anoxia and fluxes of methane in these sediments; significantly, microbes that die during the drying period can represent an important source of carbon upon re-wetting at the same time that phosphorus and nitrogen enter the system. These fluxes produce a range of responses from both prokaryote and eukaryote components of the wetland community. Detritivore and herbivore consumers in wetlands are represented by a rich variety of protists and invertebrates, especially crustaceans and insects, many of which appear to be predictably represented, taxonomically, across wetland types. These groups provide the crucial trophic link between producers and the top predators-although the trophic status of some of the latter is variable. For example, many amphibians that breed in wetlands represent both prey and predator depending on the stage in their life cycle. While salamanders may input large amounts of energy via egg deposition, many larger vertebrate inhabitants of wetlands are seen as net removers of energy from these systems (grazing, predation, etc.), with very little return (chiefly wastes)-although intuitively, they must represent important links between aquatic and terrestrial compartments. However, it must be said that the role of vertebrates in nutrient cycling and energy flow in wetlands is not well understood, and that the consequences of, for example the global decline in amphibian populations, are largely unknown. Coverage of these topics will be global in extent. Future research needs to be focused on piecing together the components of intermittent wetland function through study of: 1) physiological and phenological response to natural (e.g., hydroperiod regime) and human-induced stress by individual taxa; 2) community response to these same factors; 3) trophic function, including bottomup resources and top-down pressures; 4) interaction with, especially energy flow through, permanent sections of wetland, the riparian zone, adjacent woodlands and grasslands, and beyond. © 2009 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Comparisons between groups of paired males versus groups of unpaired males in temperate-breeding animals have revealed such differences in signalling behaviour. Few studies, however, have explored how individual males alter their signalling behaviour with changes in pairing status, and very few investigations have explored paired versus unpaired male behaviour in tropical animals. During a 5-year study in Costa Rica, we analysed changes in the singing behaviour of male rufous-and-white wrens (Thryothorus rufalbus) when they were paired and when they were bachelors. We compared three aspects of male vocal behaviour: gross differences in song output, variation in repertoire use and differences in song structure. Males as bachelors had significantly higher song output and switched song types less frequently. Contrary to our expectation, bachelors sang significantly fewer song types from their repertoire compared to when those same males had a breeding partner. Songs sung by bachelor males were higher in syllabic diversity and had broader-bandwidth terminal syllables than the songs those males sang only when paired. Within song types, the fine structure of songs remained consistent across pairing status. Our results demonstrate that males change their singing behaviour with pairing status, delivering songs at a higher rate but with less variety when they are bachelors. Rufous-and-white wrens are renowned for their vocal duets, and we discuss the pattern of repertoire use in light of their duetting behaviour. These results enhance our understanding of how male behaviour varies with pairing status and the importance of vocal signalling behaviour in socially monogamous tropical animals. © Springer-Verlag 2009.",Acoustic communication | Bachelor | Bird song | Mate attraction signals | Vocal duetting,11,0,,undefined,Society of Canadian Ornithologists

Binaural responses were studied when dichotic tone bursts with various interaural-level differences were presented simultaneously or with a contralateral delay. These dichotic tone bursts allowed us to probe temporal changes in the effect produced by an ipsilateral sound on a contralaterally elicited response. Most of the neurons in the rat's ICc were excited by contralateral and inhibited by ipsilateral stimulation. For the majority of neurons with excitatory/inhibitory interactions, the early part of an ipsilateral stimulus caused stronger inhibition than the late part. The ipsilateral stimulus frequently produced an excitatory or inhibitory ""offset"" effect that was apparent soon after cessation of the stimulus. For many neurons, this aftereffect substantially changed the strength and temporal firing pattern of the response elicited by a lagging contralateral stimulus. Our results suggest that there are time-dependent changes in the effect of ipsilateral stimulation on the pattern and strength of responses to contralateral stimulation. These effects frequently outlast the duration of a leading ipsilateral stimulus. These characteristics of binaural interaction likely reflect the time courses of converging excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs to ICc neurons as well as the intrinsic membrane properties of those neurons. © 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using site-specific recombination in Drosophila, we created two deletions that removed the entire frq1 gene and part of the frq2 gene, resulting in no detectable Frq protein. Frq-null mutants were viable, but had defects in larval locomotion, deficient synaptic transmission, impaired Ca2+ entry and enhanced nerve-terminal growth. The impaired Ca2+ entry was sufficient to account for reduced neurotransmitter release. We hypothesized that Frq either modulates Ca2+ channels, or that it regulates the PI4Kβ pathway as described in other organisms. To determine whether Frq interacts with PI4K. with consequent effects on Ca2+ channels, we first characterized a PI4Kβ-null mutant and found that PI4Kβ was dispensable for synaptic transmission and nerve-terminal growth. Frq gain-of-function phenotypes remained present in a PI4Kβ-null background. We conclude that the effects of Frq are not due to an interaction with PI4Kβ. Using flies that were trans-heterozygous for a null frq allele and a null cacophony (encoding the α1-subunit of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels) allele, we show a synergistic effect between these proteins in neurotransmitter release. Gain-of-function Frq phenotypes were rescued by a hypomorphic cacophony mutation. Overall, Frq modulates Ca2+ entry through a functional interaction with the voltage-gated Ca2+-channel subunit; this interaction regulates neurotransmission and nerveterminal growth.",Calcium channels | Drosophila | Nerve growth | Neuromuscular junction | Neuronal calcium sensor 1 | Phosphoinositide 4-kinase | Presynaptic | Quantal content | Synapticboutons,46,1,,undefined,

In addition, hypotheses based on sexual selection, which predict that sexual dimorphism should vary with population density and climatic conditions, have received little attention. Our goals were to characterize geographical variation in the coloration and morphology of golden-crowned kinglets, Regulus satrapa (Passeriformes, Regulidae), and to investigate possible ecological and sexual selection correlates of this variation. Location The entire species range of golden-crowned kinglets, comprising North and Central America. Methods We collected data from 511 museum specimens, dating from 1847 to 2006, encompassing all five subspecies of golden-crowned kinglets. We used reflectance spectrometry to quantify crown and mantle coloration, and measured wing-chord and tarsus length to approximate body size. We obtained geographical and climatic data from online databases, and population density estimates from the literature. Results There were significant subspecific and gender differences in crown coloration and morphology: male kinglets were generally larger and more colourful. Our data revealed mixed support for Bergmann's rule: tarsus length decreased with increasing latitude, while patterns of variation in wing-chord and tarsus length showed conflicting results with temperature. Mantle coloration exhibited an opposite trend to that predicted by Gloger's rule: upper parts became lighter with increasing relative humidity. Crown coloration was negatively correlated with actual evapotranspiration, suggesting that levels of primary productivity are not directly linked to carotenoid abundance. Sexual dimorphism and dichromatism generally increased with greater population density, lower latitudes and elevations, and warmer temperatures, supporting a previously observed pattern of variation in sexual dimorphism. Main conclusions Geographical variation in golden-crowned kinglets yielded mixed support for Bergmann's rule and contradicted Gloger's rule, suggesting that other mechanisms may be operating. Allen's rule is likely to be a stronger factor influencing tarsus length. Differences in the degree of sexual dimorphism and dichromatism in varying climatic conditions suggest that the intensity of sexual selection differs between habitats. Further studies on geographical variation in sexual dimorphism in various taxa may reveal a previously unrecognized ecogeographical rule. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Bergmann's rule | Birds | Geographical variation | Gloger's rule | Golden-crowned kinglet | New World | Regulus satrapa | Sexual dichromatism | Sexual dimorphism,17,0,,undefined,

In lampreys, the caudoventral portion of the peripheral olfactory organ contains tubular diverticula, named the accessory olfactory organ (AOO). Short, ciliated AOO cells were retrogradely labelled following application of biocytin or carbocyanine dyes to the medial region of the olfactory bulb. Tracer application to eight radial locations within the layer of glomeruli with mitral cells, of the olfactory bulb, showed that AOO projections were restricted to the medial region of the olfactory bulb. The outer boundary of the AOO projection extended to the ventromedial region of glomerular neuropil in 43% of the specimens.

Song structure can change over evolutionary time, or signallers can modify their behaviour, to reduce attenuation and degradation in a specific habitat. We investigated signalling behaviour in rufous-and-white wrens, Thyothorus rufalbus, a Neotropical songbird in which both sexes sing, with a specific focus on perch height. Based on previous findings, including a detailed sound transmission study, we predicted that rufous-and-white wrens would choose elevated song perches in order to maximize the distance their songs travel, and that males and females would show different perch height choices. We observed 30 birds in 18 territories in a tropical forest in Costa Rica to determine the perch heights of birds when singing, producing non-song vocalizations, collecting nesting material, foraging, and engaging in other behaviours. We found that both activity and sex influenced perch height. Birds sang from a variety of heights, but the highest perches were used as song posts by males. Males minimized singing from within 1 m of the ground, and they generally perched higher than females, which may reflect sex differences in communication strategies. Both sexes foraged on or near the ground. The finding that rufous-and-white wrens vary their perch height with specific activities suggests that they modify their singing behaviour to enhance long-distance communication. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag GmbH.",,10,0,,undefined,

Moreover, starlings showed the largest difference (94.6%) in yolk corticosterone between first- and last-laid eggs, whereas guillemots showed a moderate difference (58.9%). Despite these general species-specific patterns, individuals showed marked variation in the intra-clutch patterns of yolk corticosterone within each species indicating potential differences in intra-clutch flexibility among females. It is well documented that exposure to elevated yolk glucocorticoids reduces offspring quality at birth/hatching in many taxa and it has therefore been proposed that elevated yolk levels may modulate offspring competition and/or facilitate brood reduction under harsh conditions in birds. Our data suggests that intra-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone has the potential to act as an adaptive maternal effect in species where modulation of competition between nest-bound offspring would benefit mothers (starlings and guillemots). However, in precocial species where mothers would not benefit from a modulation of offspring quality, intra-clutch variation in yolk hormones may play little or no adaptive role. While future phylogenetically-controlled studies will be helpful in examining questions of adaptive mechanisms once more data on yolk corticosterone becomes available, our results nonetheless suggest that research on the evolutionary role of yolk hormones can benefit by a priori incorporating species-specific life-history-driven hypotheses. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

When using omnivores in biocontrol, these interactions need to be understood to maximize feeding on the target species and minimize non-target interactions. Dicyphus hesperus is used along with Encarsia formosa for biocontrol of whiteflies in greenhouse tomato crops. Dicyphus hesperus is a generalist omnivore which feeds on all components of the system. To quantify these interactions, stable isotope analysis was used to identify trophic position with nitrogen isotopes ( 15N) and plant sources with carbon isotopes ( 13C). Feeding trials were used to establish baseline isotopic data for D. hesperus and their diet, including Verbascum thapsus, an alternative plant food. Cage trials were used to monitor population abundances and the isotopic signature of D. hesperus. In feeding trials, D. hesperus were enriched relative to their food, suggesting an elevated trophic position. However, large amounts of isotopic variation were found within all diet components, with only V. thapsus exhibiting a distinct signature. In cage trials, the average 15N and 13C of the omnivore declined over time, coinciding with declines in total available prey, though it may be confounded by changes in temperature. The range of 13C, but not the range of 15N, also declined over time. This suggests a change in the plant source within the diet, but also some unquantified variability within the population. We suggest that diet variability exists within D. hesperus populations, declining as prey become less abundant. © 2009 Cambridge University Press.",Dicyphus hesperus | Diet switching | Omnivory | Stable isotope | Tomato | Whitefly,1,0,,undefined,

Here, we report on the physiological responses of southern stingrays (Dasyatis americana) which are the focus of intense marine provisioning-tourism in the Cayman Islands. Using stingrays from non-tourist sites about Grand Cayman as a basis for comparison, we show in this natural experiment that tourist-exposed stingrays exhibit hematological changes indicative of physiological costs of wildlife tourism. The novel conditions with which the stingrays must interact include non-natural food, higher injury rates (from boats, conspecifics and predators), and higher parasite loads (from crowding conditions). As a result of this year-round environment, stingrays display sub-optimal health: lower hematocrit, total serum protein concentrations, and oxidative stress (i.e., lower total antioxidant capacity combined with higher total oxidative status). Moreover, they show evidence of attenuation of the defense system: for tourist stingrays only, animals possessing both injuries and high parasite loads also exhibit lowest leukocrit, serum proteins and antioxidant potential, as well as differing proportions of differential leukocytes indicative of suppression (lymphocytes and heterophils) and down-regulation (eosinophils), thus suggesting that the physiological changes of tourist stingrays are in partial response to these stressors. While survival- and reproduction- quantification was not possible in this long-lived marine species, the physiological measures -situated within ecological context, indicate that the long-term health and survival of tourist stingrays have a significant probability of being affected. Consequently, management of the tourism attraction is essential. The indicators chosen in this study reflect general health indices and defense capabilities used across taxa, and represent a tradeoff between ease of collection/analysis and interpretation so that managers can continue the research for monitoring purposes. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Most recaptures were within 100 km of the tagging location in the nursery habitat in KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) with small scale movements occurring throughout the year. Forty-eight C. obscurus undertook movements >200 km that indicated a southerly migration between KZN and Eastern/Southern Cape (E/SC) between June and November. Seasonal northerly migrations were less well defined. The largest southerly and northerly movements were 1323 km and 1374 km, respectively. For sharks moving 1100 km south from their tagging locality in KZN, an increase in displacement occurred between June and September identifying animals beginning their migration to the E/SC. With increasing displacement, there was also an increase in minimum swimming speed. Calculated growth rates of small sharks of 10.311.5 cm year-1 were in agreement with current literature values.

This study focuses on Plk4, the most divergent member of the Plk family, which is necessary for proper cellular proliferation. More specifically, alterations in Plk4 levels cause significantly adverse mitotic defects including abnormal centrosome duplication and aberrant mitotic spindle formation. We sought to clarify the effect of reduced Plk4 levels on the cell by examining transcript profiles of Plk4 wild-type and heterozygous mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). Subsequently, the levels of several key proteins involved in the DNA damage response were examined. Results: 143 genes were found to be significantly up-regulated in the heterozygous MEFs compared to their wild-type counterparts, while conversely, 9 genes were down-regulated. Numerous genes with increased transcript levels in heterozygous MEFs were identified to be involved in p53-dependent pathways. Furthermore, examination of the promoter regions of all up- and down-regulated genes revealed that the majority contained putative p53 responsive elements. An analysis of transcript levels in MEFs after exposure to either ionizing or ultraviolet radiation revealed a significant change between wild type and heterozygous MEFS for Plk4 transcript levels upon only UV exposure. Furthermore, changes in protein levels of several important cell check-point and apoptosis regulators were examined, including p53, Chk1, Chk2, Cdc25C and p21. In heterozygous MEFs, p53, p21 and Chk2 protein levels were at significantly higher levels. Furthermore, p53 activity was increased 5 fold in the Plk4 heterozygous MEFs. Conclusion: Global transcript profiles and levels of key proteins involved in cellular proliferation and DNA damage pathways were examined in wild-type and Plk4 heterozygous MEFs. It was determined that Plk4 haploinsufficiency leads to changes in the levels of RNA accumulation for a number of key cellular genes as well as changes in protein levels for several important cell cycle/DNA damage proteins. We propose a model in which reduced Plk4 levels invoke an increase in p53 levels that leads to the aforementioned changes in global transcription profiles. © 2009 Morettin et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,9,1,,undefined,

Arx mutants exhibit lissencephaly among other anomalies. We have cloned a Xenopus aristaless homolog that appears to define specific regions of the developing forebrain. xArx2 is transcribed in blastula through neurula stages, and comes to be restricted to the ventral and lateral telencephalon, lateral diencephalon, neural floor plate of the anterior spinal cord, and somites. In this respect, Arx2 expresses in regions similar to Arx with the exception of the somites. Overexpression enlarges the telencephalon, and interference by means of antisense morpholino-mediated translation knockdown reduces growth of this area. Overexpression and inhibition studies demonstrate that misregulation of xArx2 imposes dire consequences upon patterns of differentiation not only in the forebrain where the gene normally expresses, but also in more caudal brain territories and derivatives as well. This suggests that evolutionary changes that expanded Arx-expression from ventral to dorsal prosencephalon might be one of the determinants that marked development and expansion of the telencephalon. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Arx2 | Embryogenesis | Evolution | Homeobox | Lissencephaly | Morpholino | Neural development | Telencephalon | Xenopus laevis | XSLAG,3,0,,undefined,

This process is disrupted when GSCs are forced to differentiate through the overexpression of Bag of Marbles, a factor that impels the terminal differentiation of cystoblasts. When Decapentaplegic, a ligand which maintains the undifferentiated state of GSCs, is expressed ectopically the non-random partitioning of DNA is similarly disrupted.

Data for a total of 2120 dusky sharks Carcharhinus obscurus (Lesueur, 1818), ranging in size from newborns (≤79 cm precaudal length [PCL]) to mature adults (≥210 cm PCL), were used to calculate seasonal trends in condition and to facilitate index comparisons. Four commonly used condition measures were selected, including a somatic measure, hepatosomatic index (HSI), and 3 morphometric measures, condition factor (CF), relative condition (Kn) and residual condition (RrPCL). The effect of month was significant for most condition analyses by size class, sex and reproductive state. HSI was found to be the most sensitive index and rapid indicator of condition, but its appropriate use requires the disaggregation of data by clearly defined life stages and reproductive states. The relatively large liver size of neonates and the relatively small liver size of pregnant and postpartum females may otherwise bias interpretations of seasonal variations in condition. HSI was also affected by increasing size of the animal, which confounds inter-size-class comparisons and may require the further division of life-stage data into additional size classes. The results of the 3 morphometric measures were comparable but were not correlated with HSI. CF, Kn and Rr PCL lagged behind HSI, were unable to differentiate between neonate and juvenile animals and were insensitive to short-term variations. The effect of increasing size did not affect calculated CF and RrPCL, but Kn demonstrated a negative correlation. The fact that large predators may consume large volumes of food in a single feeding event was identified as a possible complicating factor in interpreting condition indices. © Inter-Research 2009.",Carcharhinus obscurus | Condition factor | Hepatosomatic index | Morphometric condition indices | Ontogenetic variation,14,1,,undefined,

Newly fertilized eggs containing trace levels of PCBs via maternal deposition were collected from an aquaculture pond in which adult broodstock had been reared over their natural lives. The eggs were incubated using a flow through system that received the same pond water at in-situ temperatures from which they were spawned. Replicate samples of eggs were collected at six time points throughout incubation, ranging from day 0 (newly fertilized eggs) to post-hatch larvae (2-d old). Congener specific PCB fugacities in pooled egg samples showed increases over the incubation period. Just prior to hatching, incubated eggs averaged 2.7-fold higher PCB fugacities compared to fresh eggs. The increase in PCB fugacity with egg incubation time was independent of chemical KOW. After hatching, PCB residues were lost from the larvae, attenuating the maximum chemical fugacity achieved in late-incubated eggs. However, the rate of PCB elimination in the early larvae stages was KOW dependent such that a significant larvae/egg fugacity ratio was still evident for intermediate and highly hydrophobic compounds 2 d post-hatching.

Ensuring that reserve populations are connected to each other and non-reserve populations by larval dispersal allows for recovery from disturbance and is a key aspect of resilience. In general, connectivity between reserves should increase as the distance between them decreases. However, enhancing connectivity may often tradeoff against a network's ability to representatively sample the system's natural variability. This ""representation"" objective is typically measured in terms of species richness or diversity of habitats, but has other important elements (e.g., minimizing the risk that multiple reserves will be impacted by catastrophic events). Such representation objectives tend to be better achieved as reserves become more widely spaced. Thus, optimizing the location, size and spacing of reserves requires both an understanding of larval dispersal and explicit consideration of how well the network represents the broader system; indeed the lack of an integrated theory for optimizing tradeoffs between connectivity and representation objectives has inhibited the incorporation of connectivity into reserve selection algorithms. This article addresses these issues by (1) updating general recommendations for the location, size and spacing of reserves based on emerging data on larval dispersal in corals and reef fishes, and on considerations for maintaining genetic diversity; (2) using a spatial analysis of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to examine potential tradeoffs between connectivity and representation of biodiversity and (3) describing a framework for incorporating environmental fluctuations into the conceptualization of the tradeoff between connectivity and representation, and that expresses both in a common, demographically meaningful currency, thus making optimization possible. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Conservation planning | Great Barrier Reef | Larval dispersal | Marine protected area | Resilience | Risk-spreading,215,0,,undefined,

Hypotheses for the function of coordinated vocal displays differ with respect to these motivations and have been traditionally investigated by using playback to simulate varying degrees of threat to individuals and groups. We evaluated the function of coordinated vocal displays by presenting territorial groups of cooperatively breeding rufous-naped wrens, Campylorhynchus rufinucha, with three playback stimuli: solos, duets and choruses. We found that all groups responded strongly to playback by approaching the loudspeaker together, vocalizing, and performing visual displays. A composite playback response measure showed significantly more aggressive reactions to all playback treatments compared to a preplayback control period, yet did not vary across solo, duet and chorus treatments. This suggests that the playback stimuli represented equally strong threats despite the varying numbers of contributors to each stimulus, and does not support the hypothesis that coordinated vocalizations are graded signals of threat in this species. Our findings stand in contrast to previous playback studies that have reported an increase in aggression with an increasing number of simulated intruders, or an increase in coordinated vocalizations in response to solo playback. We interpret the results of our study as evidence that coordinated vocalizations function in the cooperative behaviour of joint territory defence in the rufous-naped wren. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",bird song | Campylorhynchus rufinucha | chorus | duet | playback | rufous-naped wren,20,0,,undefined,Government of Ontario

A particularly daunting application of this problem pertains to the detection of non-indigenous species (NIS) as they colonize new ecosystems. Ethical issues prevent experimental additions of NIS to most natural systems to explore the relationship between sampling intensity and the detection probability of a colonizing NIS. Here we examine this question using a recently introduced water flea, Cercopagis pengoi, in Lake Ontario. The species has biphasic population development, with sexually-produced 'spring morphs' developing prior to parthenogenetically-produced 'typical' morphs. Thus, this biphasic morphology allows distinction between new colonists (spring morphs) from subsequent generations. We repeatedly sampled Hamilton Harbour, Lake Ontario for the presence of both spring and typical morphs. Probability of detection was positively related to both the number of samples taken and animal density in the lake; however, even highly intensive sampling (100 samples) failed to detect the species in early spring when densities were very low. Spatial variation was greatest when densities of Cercopagis were intermediate to low. Sub-sampling, which increased space between adjacent samples, significantly decreased the number of samples required to reach greater, calculated detection probabilities on these dates. Typical sampling protocols for zooplankton have a low probability (< 0.2) of detecting the species unless population density is high. Results of this study suggest that early detection of colonizing, aquatic NIS may be optimized through use of a risk-based sampling design, combined with high sampling intensity in areas deemed most vulnerable to invasion, rather than less intensive sampling at a wider array of sites. © 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Biological invasions | Colonization | Detection | Invasive species | Non-indigenous species | Rare species | Sampling intensity,38,0,,undefined,

However, studies investigating relationships between the mass of specific organs and interindividual variation in BMR have produced inconsistent patterns with regard to which organs have the largest impact on BMR variation. Because of the known flexibility in organ mass and metabolic intensity within individual organs, relationships between BMR and body- composition variables are bound to be context specific. Altricial nestlings are excellent models to illustrate this phenomenon because of the extreme variation in body composition occurring during growth. Using European starlings at three age classes, we studied changes in body composition together with its effect on variation in resting metabolic rate (RMR) in order to highlight the context-specific nature of these relationships. Our data suggest a transition in metabolic costs during growth in starling nestlings. During the linear phase of growth, energy is mainly consumed by tissue-synthesis processes, with fast-growing organs having a large influence on RMR. In the plateau phase of growth, the energy expenditure is transferred to functional costs, with high-intensity organs having a predominant effect on RMR variation. Our data illustrates the context-specific nature of organ mass-metabolic rate correlations, which complicates inter- and intraspecific comparisons of BMR.

Across seasons, the bioenergetic model predicted highly variable gill ventilation and fecal egestion rates which varied by 74.2-111.2 fold and 35-65 fold, respectively, over the annual cycle. The empirical growth model accounted for seasonal trends in overwintering lipid losses evident for all fish size classes and growth, evident only for the small fish size class, during warm water periods. The toxicokinetic model described seasonal trends in congener specific PCB mass balance of fish, but tended to overestimate PCB elimination for less hydrophobic congeners when the recommended gill transfer efficiency term (EW) of 0.54 was used. Downward adjustment of E W to an average value of 0.14 produced the strongest model fit for several low KOW PCBs but had less effect on model performance for mid-to high KOW congeners. The toxicokinetic model was less sensitive to parameters involved in fecal elimination of PCBs when applied to low and mid-KOW PCBs.

Uniquely among animal visual signals, the study of iridescent coloration contributes to biological and physical sciences by enhancing our understanding of the evolution of communication strategies, and by providing insights into physical optics and inspiring biomimetic technologies useful to humans. Iridescent colours are found in a broad diversity of animal taxa ranging from diminutive marine copepods to terrestrial insects and birds. Iridescent coloration has received a surge of research interest of late, and studies have focused on both characterizing the nanostructures responsible for producing iridescence and identifying the behavioural functions of iridescent colours. In this paper, we begin with a brief description of colour production mechanisms in animals and provide a general overview of the taxonomic distribution of iridescent colours. We then highlight unique properties of iridescent signals and review the proposed functions of iridescent coloration, focusing, in particular, on the ways in which iridescent colours allow animals to communicate with conspecifics and avoid predators. We conclude with a brief overview of non-communicative functions of iridescence in animals. Despite the vast amount of recent work on animal iridescence, our review reveals that many proposed functions of iridescent coloration remain virtually unexplored, and this area is clearly ripe for future research. © 2009 The Royal Society.",Behaviour | Communication | Function | Iridescence | Predation | Sexual selection,172,1,,undefined,

In this study, we describe the acoustic structure and temporal variation in solos, duets, and choruses in the Rufous-naped Wren (Campylorhynchus rufinucha), a cooperatively breeding neotropical passerine. We collected focal recordings of 19 groups to assess both diel and seasonal variation in vocal output, as well as population-wide sharing of vocal signals. We found that birds produce a complex array of vocalisations, including tonal, frequency-modulated syllables grouped into phrases, as well as stereotyped, atonal sounds. Songs are produced as solos or combined into duets and choruses. Solo and duet songs show a dawn chorus effect. Solo song rate, but not duet or chorus rate, varied across breeding stages. The majority of phrases are shared amongst groups, significantly more amongst groups in nearby territories. We suggest that chorus songs may be an important indicator of group identity and may play a role in maintaining group territories, but do not play a role in relation to the breeding cycle.

Evaluating variation in the colour of avian study skins forms the basis for a broad range of research questions, yet few studies have investigated whether the plumage colouration of museum specimens accurately reflects colouration in wild birds. In this study, we use reflectance spectrometry to compare the plumage reflectance of avian museum skins and wild birds. We use long-tailed manakins Chiroxiphia linearis, to investigate these potential differences in colour. Long-tailed manakins are ideal for this type of study as their colourful plumage patches result from three primary plumage colouration mechanisms found in birds: melanin pigmentation, carotenoid pigmentation, and structural colouration. These features of their plumage allowed us to independently assess variation in each plumage colouration mechanism. Reflectance spectra obtained from museum specimens were very similar to those obtained from wild birds, and the colouration of specimens was usually well within the range of variation observed in wild birds. As such, museum specimens can accurately represent the colouration of wild birds. Nevertheless, we found significant differences in colouration between museum skins and wild birds. We documented differences in brightness, hue, saturation, and chroma, although the direction and magnitude of these differences varied by mechanism of colouration. Multivariate analyses revealed that the age of museum specimens and the time of year at which they were collected contributed to some of these differences. We discuss potential proximate causes of these changes in colour, many of which apply to both museum specimens and wild birds, and identify the types of studies that are likely to be most sensitive to these changes. © 2009 The Authors.",,42,0,,undefined,

This seemingly conspicuous coloration has puzzled biologists since Wallace, as natural selection should favor reduced egg visibility to minimize predation pressure. The sexual signaling hypothesis posits that blue green egg coloration serves as a signal of female quality and that males exert post-mating sexual selection on this trait by investing more in the nests of females laying more intensely blue green eggs. This hypothesis has received mixed support to date, and most previous studies have been conducted in cavity-nesting species where male evaluation of his partner's egg coloration, relative to that of other females, may be somewhat limited. In this study, we test the sexual signaling hypothesis in colonially nesting ring-billed gulls (Larus delawarensis) where males have ample opportunity to assess their mate's egg coloration relative to that of other females. We used correlational data and an experimental manipulation to test four assumptions and predictions of the sexual signaling hypothesis: (1) blue green pigmentation should be limiting to females; (2) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to female quality; (3) extent of blue green egg coloration should relate to offspring quality; and (4) males should provide more care to clutches with higher blue green chroma. Our data provide little support for these predictions of the sexual signaling hypothesis in ring-billed gulls. In light of this and other empirical data, we encourage future studies to consider additional hypotheses for the evolution of blue green egg coloration. © 2009 Springer-Verlag.",Biliverdin | Egg coloration | Parental investment | Ring-billed gull | Sexual signaling hypothesis,43,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

For both methods, we examined the time required to process a 24-h recording, scanning accuracy, and scanning comprehensiveness using four different target sounds of Pileated Woodpeckers (Dryocopus pileatus), Pale-billed Woodpeckers (Campephilus guatemalensis), and putative Ivory-billed Woodpeckers (Campehilus principalis).

Wildlife tourism can be prone to unmitigated development to promote visitor satisfaction that is all too often progressed at the cost of ecological integrity. A manager is thus faced with the dual task of enhancing the tourist experience and protecting the wildlife species. Accordingly, this mandate requires research into how tourists would respond to proposed wildlife-management plans. 2. This study examines the heterogeneity of tourist preferences for wildlife management at a stingray-feeding attraction in the Cayman Islands, using a latent class stated preference choice model. A sample of visitors to Stingray City Sandbar (SCS) evaluated hypothetical wildlife viewing experiences in a discrete choice experiment. Its scenarios were characterized by seven attributes such as animal-feeding and handling rules, ecological outcomes, social crowding, and management cost (defined as a conservation access fee). 3. The latent class segmentation identified two groups in the population: approximately 68% preferred the implementation of fairly strict management rules, while the other 32% valued more the maintenance of status quo with its intensive human}wildlife interactions. Despite the differences between the 'pro-management' and the 'pro-current' segments, both exhibited a preference for the continuation of feeding and handling the stingrays (albeit at different levels of intensity) suggesting that one effective way to implement any management actions is to alter the promotional and marketing strategies for SCS. Other survey questions on trip experience, conservation values, and socio-demographics were used to define these classes further, with the main distinguishing trait being the level of concern for potential impacts occurring at SCS. The discrepancies between the two segments became most obvious when calculating their respective market shares of support for alternative management strategies. 4. This approach to determining visitor preferences can help explain how the various segments will be affected by management options, and therefore can provide the basis for developing feasible strategies that will assist wildlife managers in maximizing tourist satisfaction while achieving wildlife-protection goals. © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Human dimensions of wildlife | Latent class analysis | Marine wildlife tourism | Marine-tourism management | Stated preference choice model | Stingray,36,0,,undefined,

Juvenile bicolor damselfish (Stegastes partitus) were sampled at 13 sites along the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef System (MBRS), the barrier reefs on the east coast of Central America extending from the Yucatan, Mexico to Honduras, to evaluate genetic structure among recently settled cohorts. Using genotype data at eight microsatellite loci genetic structure was estimated at large and small spatial scales using exact tests for allele frequency differences and hierarchical analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). Isolation-by-distance models of divergence were assessed at both spatial scales. Results showed genetic homogeneity of recently settled S. partitus at large geographic scales with subtle, but significant, genetic structure at smaller geographic scales. Genetic temporal stability was tested for using archived juvenile S. partitus collected earlier in the same year (nine sites), and in the previous year (six sites). The temporal analyses indicated that allele frequency differences among sites were not generally conserved over time, nor were pairwise genetic distances correlated through time, indicative of temporal instability. These results indicate that S. partitus larvae undergo high levels of dispersal along the MBRS, and that the structure detected at smaller spatial scales is likely driven by stochastic effects on dispersal coupled with microgeographic effects. Temporal variation in juvenile cohort genetic signature may be a fundamental characteristic of connectivity patterns in coral reef fishes, with various species and populations differing only in the magnitude of that instability. Such a scenario provides a basis for the reconciliation of conflicting views regarding levels of genetic structuring in S. partitus and possibly other coral reef fish species. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",Coral reef fish | Dispersal | Genetic structure | Microsatellite | Spatial | Temporal,24,0,,CRO-227965,Canada Research Chairs

Although many of these effects appear to be transiently 'negative', embryonic exposure to maternally derived stress hormones is hypothesized to induce preparative responses that increase survival prospects for offspring in low-quality environments; however, little is known about how maternal stress influences longer-term survival-related performance traits in free-living individuals. Using an experimental elevation of yolk corticosterone (embryonic signal of low maternal quality), we examined potential impacts of embryonic exposure to maternally derived stress on flight performance, wing loading, muscle morphology and muscle physiology in juvenile European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Here we report that fledglings exposed to experimentally increased corticosterone in ovo performed better during flight performance trials than control fledglings. Consistent with differences in performance, individuals exposed to elevated embryonic corticosterone fledged with lower wing loading and had heavier and more functionally mature flight muscles compared with control fledglings. Our results indicate that the positive effects on a survival-related trait in response to embryonic exposure to maternally derived stress hormones may balance some of the associated negative developmental costs that have recently been reported. Moreover, if embryonic experience is a good predictor of the quality or risk of future environments, a preparative phenotype associated with exposure to apparently negative stimuli during development may be adaptive. © 2008 The Royal Society.",Corticosterone | Embryonic stress | European starling | Flight performance | Survival | Yolk hormones,79,0,,undefined,

Recently, we have provided a novel resolution to the paradox by showing that nonadditive genetic effects such as overdominance can be inherited from parent to offspring, and populations with females that express a mating preference for outbred males maintain higher genetic variation than populations with females that mate randomly. Here, we test our dynamic model using empirical data previously published from a small island population of song sparrows (Melospiza melodia). The model assumes that fitness and male trait expression display overdominance effects. The results demonstrate that female choice for outbred males mediated by directional selection on song repertoire size provides a heritable benefit to offspring through reduced inbreeding depression. Within the population, we estimate the heritability of the inbreeding coefficient to be 0.18 ± 0.08 (SD). Furthermore, we show that mate choice for outbred males increases fitness-related genetic variation in the population by 12% and thereby reduces inbreeding depression by 1% per generation in typical years and upwards of 15% in severe years. Thus, mate choice may help to stave off population extinction in this and other small populations. © 2008 The Authors.",Compatible genes | Directional selection | Heterozygosity | Lek paradox | Mate choice | Sexual selection | Song sparrow,7,0,,undefined,

Predicting spread of non-indigenous species requires an understanding of where propagules are being transported, and whether these propagules can survive in the novel habitat and successfully integrate into the recipient community. In this study, we model potential spread of invading Cabomba caroliniana in Ontario, Canada, using a combination of passive and active dispersal models coupled with an environmental suitability model, thereby considering the first two stages of the invasion process. 2. Measures of propagule pressure incorporated both human-mediated dispersal via trailered boats, and advective flow from invaded to non-invaded systems, while habitat suitability was forecasted by combining native and global data sets and using boosted regression trees. 3. Risk of invasion differed depending on the combination of approaches used and the time period considered. Three lakes appear to be at greatest risk owing to a combination of high boater and water movement from invaded sources, and high environmental suitability. The best predictors of lake suitability were pH, mean lake temperature and dissolved calcium concentration. Hundreds of lakes in Ontario may be suitable for establishment of Cabomba, highlighting the need for vector management. © 2008 The Authors.",Boosted regression trees | Environmental niche modelling | Gravity model | Non-indigenous species | Propagule pressure,39,0,,undefined,

Competing foragers are affected by the distribution of resources, but can also affect resource distribution. Intraguild predators may affect the distribution of both the shared prey and the intraguild prey, which are also their competitors. 2. Variation in foraging strategies and their effects on resource distributions may influence the outcome of intraguild interactions between an intraguild predator and its intraguild prey. This was tested using whitefly Trialeurodes vaporariorum as the shared resource, the parasitoid Encarsia formosa as the intraguild prey, and Dicyphus hesperus, an omnivore, as the intraguild predator on tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and mullein (Verbascum thapsus) plants, within enclosures in a greenhouse. Treatments were established with and without the intraguild predator and at high and low intraguild prey densities. 3. The interaction between D. hesperus and E. formosa showed significant asymmetry, with D. hesperus populations being unaffected by E. formosa densities, although E. formosa populations were reduced by the inclusion of D. hesperus. However, the inclusion of D. hesperus diminished density-dependent effects limiting E. formosa populations at high release densities. 4. Dicyphus hesperus reduced the average patch size and the proportion of patches occupied by whitefly. Increasing the release rate of E. formosa had no effect on any distributional measure. Based upon the foraging ecology of both species, the foraging activities of D. hesperus appear to have modified the patch distribution so that its foraging strategy becomes more successful than that of E. formosa. These properties may provide an important mechanism determining the outcome of species interactions. © 2008 The Authors.",Community dynamics | Density mediated | Foraging strategies | Non-additive interactions | Patch dynamics | Spatial dynamics,5,0,,undefined,

Here, we evaluate temporal stability in five populations of Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the Upper Fraser River, British Columbia, Canada, based on estimates of temporal allelic variance and effective population size (N e) at 11 microsatellite loci. Significant temporal variation in allele frequencies was found within individual populations sampled at 5- to 12-year intervals. Removal of migrant fish or correcting for migrants resulted in higher allelic variance or reduced Ne. Populations with higher levels of temporally consistent gene flow show reduced temporal allelic variance (i.e., reduced genetic drift) and higher Ne. This study is an important empirical example of the effect of gene flow on genetic stability and Ne. In salmonids, low straying levels may have evolved to favor local adaptation; however, we show that even such low levels of gene flow can elevate effective population sizes and preserve genetic variability.

The Laurentian Great Lakes are among the most invaded freshwater ecosystems in the world. Historically, the major vector for the introduction of non-indigenous species (NIS) has been the release of contaminated ballast water via transoceanic ships. Despite regulations implemented in 1993, requiring vessels carrying fresh ballast water to exchange this water with saline ocean water, new reports of invasions have continued. 2. NIS often have a wide environmental tolerance allowing them to adapt to and invade a variety of habitats. It has been hypothesized that NIS with broad salinity tolerance may be able to survive ballast water exchange (BWE) and continue to pose an invasion risk to the Great Lakes. 3. We tested the short-term salinity tolerance of eight recent invaders to the Great Lakes, specifically three cladocera (Bosmina coregoni, Bythotrephes longimanus, Cercopagis pengoi), two molluscs (Dreissena polymorpha, Dreissena rostriformis bugensis), and one species each of the families Gammaridae, Mysidae and Gobidae (Echinogammarus ischnus, Hemimysis anomala, Neogobius melanostomus) to determine if they could have survived salinities associated with BWE. 4. Overall, short-term exposure to highly saline water dramatically reduced survival of all species. Two different methods of BWE tested, simultaneous and sequential, were equally effective in reducing survival. Species that survived the longest in highly saline water either possess behavioural characteristics that reduce exposure to adverse environments (valve closure; both Dreissena species) or are reported to have some degree of salinity tolerance in their native region (Echinogammarus). Given that exposure in our trials lasted a maximum of 48 h, and that species in ballast tanks would typically be exposed to saline water for c. 5 days, it appears that BWE is an effective method to reduce the survival of these NIS. These results provide impetus for tightening policy and monitoring of BWE, in particular for ships entering the Great Lakes from freshwater ports. © 2008 The Authors.",Ballast water exchange | Biological invasions | Great Lakes | Non-indigenous species | Salinity tolerance,41,0,,undefined,

The OSPM will contain elevated salinity and organics such as naphthenic acids (NA) and polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAC) that can be chronically toxic to aquatic organisms depending upon levels and age. Due to the complexity of the chemical mixtures, analysis of these compounds in exposed organisms can be challenging. In this study, the stable carbon and nitrogen isotope signatures of selected invertebrates from various types of oil sands reclamation sites were analyzed to determine whether stable isotopes can be used to trace the exposure of aquatic organisms to organic constituents of OSPM. In a series of experimental reclamation ponds of similar age and size, there were trends of 13C depletion and 15N enrichment for benthic invertebrates along a gradient of increased levels of MFT and/or TPW. A survey of 16 sites revealed high δ15N values for invertebrates in aquatic systems containing MFT and CT (gypsum-treated mixes of MFT and tailings sand), which was attributed to the presence of NH4+, a process by-product in OSPM. Findings of this study indicate a potential for the use of stable nitrogen isotopes to define exposure of biota to OSPM during environmental effects monitoring programs both in surface waters and in cases where groundwater seepage containing oil sands processed water enters surface receiving environments in the region.

Here we summarize data gathered along the U.S. Lake Huron coastline for breeding bird, diatom, fish, invertebrate, and wetland plant communities. We sampled these biotic communities on 88 sites in Lake Huron coastal wetlands, uplands, estuaries/bays, and high-energy shorelines. The sites were selected as part of a larger, stratified random design for the entire U.S. Great Lakes coastal region using gradients of anthropogenic stress that incorporated over 200 stressor variables (e.g. agriculture, land cover, human populations, and point source pollution). The U.S. Lake Huron coastal region exemplified wide variation in human-related stress relative to the entire U.S. Great Lakes coast. In general, levels of stress decreased from south to north partly reflecting the change in climate and physiography, but also due to the greater human influences in the southern region as compared with the north. The primary stressors in the southern region are due to agriculture and human development, while the northern region has substantially less agriculture and less human population. The biotic communities sampled were strongly related to the environmental stress gradients, especially agriculture and urbanization. The following indicators were developed based on responses to stress: 1) an index of biological condition for breeding bird communities corresponding to land use, 2) a diatom-inferred total phosphorus indicator corresponding to water quality, 3) exotic fish (carp [Cyprinus carpio] and goldfish [Carassius auratus]) corresponding to agriculture, and 4) a multi-taxa index for wetland plants corresponding to a cumulative stress index. These communities can all serve as useful indicators of the ecological condition of the Lake Huron coast. The ecological indicators provide a baseline on selected conditions for the U.S. Lake Huron coastal region and a means to detect change over time.

Recent studies have correlated elevated pMP levels with pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The pro-aggregatory effect of pMP has been largely attributed to their negatively charged outer surface and activation of factor X by membrane associated Tissue factor (TF). Here we sought to investigate whether, like platelets, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) is present on the surface of pMP and, if so, to analyze its contribution to platelet hyperaggregability and insulin degradation. Using a fluorescent assay based upon a novel pseudo-substrate of PDI, flow cytometry and immunological techniques, we have demonstrated the presence of PDI on the surface of pMP (termed msPDI) and its ability to influence insulin-mediated Akt phosphorylation (Thr308) in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts. Moreover, pMP are shown to contain catalytically active PDI, capable of both promoting platelet aggregation and disrupting insulin signaling. pMP increased initial rates of aggregation by 4-fold and the pro-aggregatory activity of pMPs could be attenuated with an anti-PDI antibody. The pMP insulin-reductase activity was further attributed to PDI based on the ability of anti-PDI antibodies to block the degradation of insulin, thereby restoring insulin signaling. Plasma pMP counts were also obtained from diabetic (n = 10) and non-diabetic individuals (n = 10) and found to be elevated in the diabetic state. Detection of increased levels of PDI-containing microparticles in patients with T2D raises the possibility that platelet hypersensitivity and insulin desensitization observed in diabetes can partially be attributed to msPDI activity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The diatoms of the ancient Malili Lakes, located on central Sulawesi, exhibit levels of endemism unequaled elsewhere in the world. Interestingly, the diatom community of the lakes is taxonomically impoverished, and the entire order Centrales is conspicuous by its absence. In this article we review the mechanisms contributing to the development and maintenance of community composition and relative abundance of taxa within the system, at within-lake and system-wide scales. Our findings demonstrate that stochastic processes related to biogeography and colonization have had little influence on the diatom flora of the lakes, and deterministic processes related to competition, selection, speciation, and adaptive radiation, functioning on very small spatial scales, have contributed greatly to the diversity, community structure, and endemism of the system. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Ancient lakes | Community ecology | Diatoms | Malili Lakes,17,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Hypothesis: Carotenoid-based pigmentation of salmon eggs provides increased offspring survival during incubation and elevated disease resistance upon seawater entry. Organism: Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, Walbaum); Quinsam River, Chehalis River, and domestic stocks. Methods: We tested for correlations of egg carotenoid levels measured in Chinook salmon eggs reared as maternal families with (1) incubation survival and (2) specific disease (vibriosis) challenge resistance. Conclusions: Egg carotenoids were primarily astaxanthin and declined throughout larval development. Incubation survival and disease resistance were significantly and positively correlated with mean family carotenoid concentration measured in eggs. A 1.0 μg·g-1 increase in egg carotenoid concentration confers an approximately 10% survival benefit. However, the incubation-survival relationship was asymptotic, indicating a threshold effect of carotenoids on incubation survival. Egg carotenoid concentration was also positively correlated with specific disease resistance 7 months later in life. © 2008 Daniel D.

It has been suggested that many of the species radiations, as well as the paucity of cosmopolitan species in the lakes, are related to resource limitation. In order to substantiate the possibility that resource limitation is playing such an important role, a study of the phytoplankton and zooplankton communities of Lake Matano was implemented between 2000 and 2004. We determined species diversity, relative abundances, size ranges, and total biomass for the phytoplankton and zooplankton, including the distribution of ovigerous individuals throughout the epilimnion of Lake Matano in three field seasons. The phytoplankton community exhibited very low biomass (<15 μg l -1) and species richness was depressed. The zooplankton assemblage was also limited in biomass (2.5 mg l-1) and consisted only of three taxa including the endemic calanoid Eodiaptomus wolterecki var. matanensis, the endemic cyclopoid, Tropocyclops matanensis and the rotifer Horaella brehmi. Zooplankton were very small (<600 μm body length), and spatial habitat partitioning was observed, with Tropocylops being confined to below 80 m, while rotifer and calanoid species were consistently observed above 80 m. Less than 0.1% of the calanoid copepods in each year were egg-bearing, suggesting very low population turnover rates. It was concluded that chemical factors as opposed to physical or biological processes were regulating the observed very low standing crops of phytoplankton which in turn supports a very minimal zooplankton community restricted in both species composition and abundance. As chemical factors are a function of the catchment basin of Lake Matano, it is predicted that resource limitation has long played an important role in shaping the unique endemic assemblages currently observed in the food web of the lake. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Community structure | Lake Matano | Phytoplankton | Tropical limnology | Zooplankton,12,0,,undefined,

Despite its ubiquity, the function of dawn chorusing remains poorly understood. We tested the social dynamics hypothesis, which states that males sing at dawn to mediate their social relationships with neighbors through interactive communication. Using a 16-microphone acoustic location system, we recorded 29 entire dawn choruses in 10 neighborhoods of 6-10 territorial male black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) of known dominance rank. We analyzed song frequency matching and overlapping between neighboring males in 10 choruses and compared the intensity of these behaviors with social factors. Chickadees matched the frequency of their neighbor's songs more often than expected by chance. The level of matching was higher between neighbors who belonged to different flocks during the previous winter than between neighbors who had been flockmates. Males of the same dominance rank matched each other more than males of disparate ranks. There was no relationship between matching and pairing status or distance between opponents. Overlapping was used less than expected by chance. No measures of song overlapping were related to measured social factors. Our results show that neighboring male chickadees interact vocally at dawn by frequency matching. This is the first study to show that the intensity of songbird vocal interactions at dawn varies with social factors, supporting the social dynamics hypothesis. © The Author 2008.

Temporal changes in plasma contaminant levels were determined in 1990 and 2003, and spatial patterns in 2003 at 12 sites, throughout the species' range. During this period, the watersnakes' diet changed from fish (75%) and amphibians (25%) that avoid zebra mussels, to round gobies (95%) that feed extensively on zebra mussels. Temporal trends indicate that watersnakes on Pelee and North Bass Islands showed a marginal increase in hexachlorobenzene levels, and a significant decline in dieldrin, oxychlordane, and heptachlor epoxide, likely reflecting declines in aerial deposition and clearing of local vineyards. The contaminants with the greatest burdens, sum PCBs and p,p′-DDE, remained stable in the snakes, consistent with trends in other local biota, suggesting that although the dietary switch to round gobies meant consumption of a more contaminated diet, their diet remained at the same trophic position. We suggest that the watersnakes' PCB and p,p′-DDE temporal patterns reflect the lack of change in sediment concentrations with minimal influence from their dietary switch. Similar to top avian predators, PCBs, p,p′-DDE, and technical chlordane, are most prevalent in watersnakes; this ranking remains unchanged. In 2003, the watersnakes demonstrated significant spatial differences in concentrations of p,p′-DDE, dieldrin, technical chlordane and its metabolites. Their 2003 concentrations of p,p′-DDE, and to a lesser extent PCBs, exceed the recommended interim no-observable effects levels on watersnake embryonic survival. Further investigations are required to determine if these higher levels of PCBs, p,p′-DDE, and technical chlordane, affect reproductive and physiological parameters of the Lake Erie watersnake. Until concentrations of sediment contaminants decline in western Lake Erie, these endangered/threatened watersnakes will continue to be exposed to higher concentrations of persistent organic pollutants.

Lake trout is a stenothermal, cold water species and sensitive to hypoxia. Thus, factors such as lake depth, thermal stratification, and phosphorus enrichment may determine not only which lakes can support lake trout but may also influence among-lake variability in lake trout population characteristics including bioaccumulation of OCs. A survey of 23 lakes spanning much of the natural latitudinal distribution of lake trout provided a range of lake trout habitat to test the hypothesis that lake trout with greater access to littoral habitat for feeding will have lower concentrations of OCs than lake trout that are more restricted to pelagic habitat. Using the δ13C stable isotope signature in lake trout as an indicator of influence of benthic littoral feeding, we found a negative correlation between lipid-corrected δ13C and ΣPCB concentrations supporting the hypothesis that increasing access to littoral habitat results in lower OCs in lake trout. The prominence of mixotrophic phytoplankton in lakes with more contaminated lake trout indicated the pelagic microbial food web may exacerbate the biomagnification of OCs when lake trout are restricted to pelagic feeding.

However, anoxygenic phototrophs have yet to be identified in modern environments with comparable chemistry and physical structure to the ancient Fe(II)-rich (ferruginous) oceans from which BIFs deposited. Lake Matano, Indonesia, the eighth deepest lake in the world, is such an environment. Here, sulfate is scarce (<20 μmol·liter -1), and it is completely removed by sulfate reduction within the deep, Fe(II)-rich chemocline. The sulfide produced is efficiently scavenged by the formation and precipitation of FeS, thereby maintaining very low sulfide concentrations within the chemocline and the deep ferruginous bottom waters. Low productivity in the surface water allows sunlight to penetrate to the >100-m-deep chemocline. Within this sulfide-poor, Fe(II)-rich, illuminated chemocline, we find a populous assemblage of anoxygenic phototrophic green sulfur bacteria (GSB). These GSB represent a large component of the Lake Matano phototrophic community, and bacteriochlorophyll e, a pigment produced by low-light-adapted GSB, is nearly as abundant as chlorophyll a in the lake's euphotic surface waters. The dearth of sulfide in the chemocline requires that the GSB are sustained by phototrophic oxidation of Fe(II), which is in abundant supply. By analogy, we propose that similar microbial communities, including populations of sulfate reducers and photoferrotrophic GSB, likely populated the chemoclines of ancient ferruginous oceans, driving the genesis of BIFs and fueling early marine productivity. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.",Anoxygenic photosynthesis | Banded iron formation | Green sulfur bacteria | Iron oxidation | Lake matano,142,1,,undefined,

Although embryonic exposure to maternally derived glucocorticoids (i.e., corticosterone) generally reduces offspring quality, effects may adaptively match maternal quality with offspring demand. We present results from an interannual field experiment in European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) designed explicitly to examine the fitness consequences of exposing offspring to maternally derived stress hormones. We combined a manipulation of yolk corticosterone (yolk injections) with a manipulation of maternal chick-rearing ability (feather clipping of mothers) to quantify the adaptive value of corticosterone-induced offspring phenotypes in relation to maternal quality. We then examined how corticosterone-induced ""matching"" within this current reproductive attempt affected future fecundity and maternal survival. First, our results provide support that low-quality mothers transferring elevated corticosterone to eggs invest in daughters as predicted by sex allocation theory. Second, corticosterone-mediated sex-biased investment resulted in rapid male-biased mortality resulting in brood reduction, which provided a better match between maternal quality and brood demand. Third, corticosterone-mediated matching reduced investment in current reproduction for low-quality mothers, resulting in fitness gains through increased survival and future fecundity. Results indicate that the transfer of stress hormones to eggs by low-quality mothers can be adaptive since corticosterone-mediated sex-biased investment matches the quality of a mother to offspring demand, ultimately increasing maternal fitness. Our results also indicate that the branding of the proximate effects of maternal glucocorticoids on offspring as negative ignores the possibility that short-term phenotypic changes may actually increase maternal fitness. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.

Overall, the results of the present study show that biomagnification of PCBs and most OCPs, as measured by TMFs, is only weakly influenced by such factors as latitude and longitude. Exceptions are hexachlorocyclohexane isomers and hexachlorobenzene, which had generally greater TMFs in northern lakes, possibly due to lower rates of elimination and biotransformation in the food web. © 2008 SETAC Printed in the USA.",Biomagnification | Lake characteristics | Lake trout food webs | Persistent organic pollutants,62,0,,undefined,

At dawn, males may sing near the nest or roost to direct their chorus at mates. Recent evidence suggests males may also be involved in singing interactions with neighbours during the dawn chorus. We used a 16-channel acoustic location system to examine the movement behaviour of 37 male black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, during the dawn chorus to determine if male proximity to the nest is a function of breeding stage. Males with fertile females covered a significantly smaller area within their territory, made fewer long-distance movements and sang at a lower song rate compared to males with nonfertile females. Males with fertile mates remained significantly closer to their nest cavity than males with incubating mates. Males with nonfertile mates spent more time near their neighbours with fertile mates than near their neighbours with nonfertile mates. Neither social rank nor age had a significant effect on movement behaviour or song rate. Our results clearly show that female fertility influences dawn chorusing behaviour in male black-capped chickadees.

Three blends of steroids were used, including: etiocholanolone (3α-hydroxy-5β-androstan-17-one), 11-oxo-etiocholanolone (3α-hydroxy-5β-androstane-11,17-dione), androstenedione, 11β-hydroxy-androstenedione, and 11-ketotestosterone ('free' steroid blend); etiocholanolone glucuronide, etiocholanolone sulfate, 11-oxo-etiocholanolone glucuronide and 11-oxo-etiocholanolone sulfate ('conjugated' steroid blend); and all nine steroids together ('total' steroid blend).

Blow fly evidence was collected from three mock crime scenes and sent for blind analysis of PMI. PMI estimates were calculated using averaging, single sine, double sine, single triangle, and double triangle models of DD calculation with minimum developmental thresholds of 0, 6 and 10 °C and Anderson's, Byrd and Allen's, Greenberg's, Nishida's and Kamal's developmental data sets. These estimates were compared with the actual PMI to determine which combination of DD model, developmental threshold and developmental data provided the most accurate estimate. For all three cases, at least one method gave a PMI estimation that was within 1 day of the actual date of death. There was no variability between PMI estimated using the five models of DD calculation. Overall, as lower developmental threshold increased, the PMI interval estimates increased. Depending on the developmental data set used, increasing the lower developmental threshold caused some overestimations of the date of oviposition, with estimates given that were prior to the actual death. Future PMI estimates should include error ranges, so that overestimation of PMI is avoided. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Duets are often so highly coordinated that human listeners mistake them for the songs of a single animal [6]. Behavioral ecologists rank duets among the most complex vocal performances in the animal kingdom [7, 8]. Despite much research, the evolutionary significance of duets remains elusive [9], in part because many duetting animals live in tropical habitats where dense vegetation makes behavioral observation difficult or impossible. Here, we evaluate the duetting behavior of rufous-and-white wrens (Thryothorus rufalbus) in the humid forests of Costa Rica. We employ two innovative technical approaches to study duetting behavior: an eight-microphone acoustic location system capable of triangulating animals' positions on the basis of recordings of their vocalizations [10] and dual-speaker playback capable of simulating duets in a spatially realistic manner [11]. Our analyses provide the first detailed spatial information on duetting in both a natural context and during confrontations with rivals. We demonstrate that birds perform duets across highly variable distances, that birds approach their partner after performing duets, and that duets of rivals induce aggressive, sex-specific responses. We conclude that duets serve distinct functions in aggressive and nonaggressive contexts. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",EVO_ECOL,71,1,,R01-MH60461,University of Windsor

However, strong directional selection should deplete additive genetic variation in fitness and consequently any benefit to expressing the preference by females (referred to as the lek paradox). Here, we provide a novel resolution that examines non-additive genetic benefits, such as overdominance or inbreeding, as a source of genetic variation. Focusing on the inbreeding coefficient f and overdominance effects, we use dynamic models to show that (1) f can be inherited from sire to offspring, (2) populations with females that express a mating preferences for outbred males (low f) maintain higher genetic variation than populations with females that mate randomly, and (3) preference alleles for outbred males can invade populations even when the alleles are associated with a fecundity cost. We show that non-additive genetic variation due to overdominance can be converted to additive genetic variation and becomes ""heritable"" when the frequencies of alternative homozygous genotypes at fitness loci deviate from equality. Unlike previous models that assume an infinite population size, we now show that genetic drift in finite populations can lead to the necessary deviations in the frequencies of homozygous genotypes. We also show that the ""heritability of f,"" and hence the benefit to a mating preference for non-additive genetic benefits, is highest in small populations and populations in which a smaller number of loci contribute to fitness via overdominance.

Research in laboratory mammals has suggested that maternally-induced stress can cause significant variation in the responsiveness of an offspring's HPA axis involving both pre- and post-natal developmental mechanisms. However, very little is known regarding effects of maternal stress on the variability of offspring adrenocortical functioning in free-living vertebrates. Here we use an experimental approach that independently lowers the quality of both the pre- and post-natal developmental environment to examine programming and plasticity in the responsiveness of the HPA axis in fledglings of a free-living passerine, the European starling (Sturnus vulgaris). We found that mimicking a hormonal signal of poor maternal condition via an experimental pre-natal increase in yolk corticosterone decreased the subsequent responsiveness of the HPA axis in fledglings. Conversely, decreasing the quality of the post-natal developmental environment (by decreasing maternal provisioning capability via a maternal feather-clipping manipulation) increased subsequent responsiveness of the HPA axis in fledglings, apparently through direct effects on nestling body condition. The plasticity of these responses was sex-specific with smaller female offspring showing the largest increase in HPA reactivity. We suggest that pre-natal, corticosterone-induced, plasticity in the HPA axis may be a 'predictive adaptive response' (PAR): a form of adaptive developmental plasticity where the advantage of the induced phenotype is manifested in a future life-history stage. Further, we introduce a new term to define the condition-driven post-natal plasticity of the HPA axis to an unpredictable post-natal environment, namely a 'reactive adaptive response' (RAR). This study confirms that the quality of both the pre- and post-natal developmental environment can be a significant source of variation in the responsiveness of the HPA axis, and provides a frame-work for examining ecologically-relevant sources of stress-induced programming and plasticity in this endocrine system in a free-living vertebrate, respectively. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

One source of genetic incompatibility is the degree of relatedness among mates; unrelated males are expected to be genetically more compatible with a female than her relatives. To address this idea, we investigated the potential for inbreeding depression and paternity biasing mechanisms (pre- and post-copulatory) of inbreeding avoidance in the guppy, Poecilia reticulata. Inbreeding resulted in a reduction in offspring number and quality. Females mated to siblings gave birth to significantly fewer offspring compared to females mated to non-siblings and inbred male offspring took longer to reach sexual maturity. There was no evidence of inbreeding avoidance in pre-copulatory behaviors of females or males. Sexual responsiveness of females to courting males and the number of sexual behaviors males directed at females did not decrease as a function of the relatedness of the two individuals. We also tested whether female guppies can use post-copulatory mechanisms to bias sperm usage toward unrelated males by comparing the number of offspring produced by females mated to two of their siblings (SS), two males unrelated to the female (NN), or to one unrelated male and a sibling male (NS). We found that NS females produced a number of offspring not significantly different than what would be expected if fertilization success were halfway between completely outbreeding (NN) and completely inbreeding (SS) females. This suggests that there is no significant improvement in the number of offspring produced by females mating to both related and unrelated males, relative to that which would be expected if sperm from both males were used equally. Our results suggest that female guppies do not discriminate against closely related males or their sperm. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cryptic female choice | Genetic compatibility | Inbreeding depression | Mate choice | Sperm competition,30,0,UofT,undefined,University of Toronto

However, we lack information on (1) how the immune system is managed across life-history stages, (2) whether the sexes manage immunity differentially, and (3) whether immunity is repeatable within an individual. We present a within-individual, repeated-measures experiment examining life-history stage variation in the inflammatory immune response in the zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata). In juveniles, age-dependent variation in immune response differed in a sex- and context-specific manner, resulting in no repeatability across stages. In adults, females displayed little stage-dependent variation in immune response when laying while receiving a high-quality (HQ) diet; however, laying while receiving a low-quality (LQ) diet significantly reduced both immune responses and reproductive outputs in amanner consistent with a facultative (resource-driven) effect of reproduction on immunity. Moreover, a reduced immune response in females who were raising offspring while receiving an HQ diet suggests a residual effect of the energetic costs of reproduction. Conversely, adult males displayed no variation in immune responses across stages, with high repeatability from the nonbreeding stage to the egg-laying stage, regardless of diet quality (HQ diet, r = 0.51; LQ diet, r = 0.42). Females displayed high repeatability when laying while receiving the HQ diet (r = 0.53); however, repeatability disappeared when individuals received the LQ diet. High-response females receiving the HQ diet had greater immune flexibility than did low-response females who were laying while receiving the LQ diet. Data are consistent with immunity being a highly plastic trait that is sex-specifically modulated in a context-dependent manner and suggest that immunity at one stage may provide limited information about immunity at future stages. © 2008 by The University of Chicago.",Cell-mediated immunity | Individual variation | Life-history theory | Repeatability | Sex-specific differences | Zebra finch (taeniopygia guttata),45,0,,undefined,

Victory displays may reinforce the dominance of the winner either to the loser or to other conspecifics within signaling range. Victory displays are poorly studied despite the significant consequences that post-conflict behaviour may have on the individuals involved. We examined the period immediately following 50 territorial countersinging contests between males in 10 neighbourhoods of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) of known dominance rank. We characterized the post-contest singing behaviour of chickadees and evaluated whether post-contest behaviour is consistent with victory displays. Using a 16-microphone acoustic location system to simultaneously record entire neighbourhoods of breeding chickadees, we isolated 50 dyadic countersinging contests and measured the vocal behaviour of the contestants in the minutes following each interaction. Eighty-six percent of contests were followed by a period of solo singing by one of the contestants, while 14% were followed by silence. The post-contest singer was most often the contestant who held a subordinate dominance position in the previous winter's dominance hierarchy; dominant males performed post-contest song bouts significantly less often. Asymmetry in overlapping between contestants did not predict which bird sang a post-contest bout. However, in a significant majority of cases, the post-contest singer was pitch-matched by his opponent during the contest more than he pitch-matched his opponent. Our results indicate that male chickadees do not perform acoustic victory displays after countersinging contests. In contrast, the post-contest behaviour of territorial chickadees is more consistent with a ""loser display"". © 2008 Springer-Verlag and ISPA.",Black-capped chickadee | Communication network | Countersinging | Overlapping | Song matching | Victory displays,9,0,,undefined,Society of Canadian Ornithologists

Here, we use experimental spawning channels to assess phenotypic and genotypic correlates of reproductive success in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). Groups of 36 fish in three different sex ratios (1:2, 1:1 and 2:1) were allowed to spawn and the offspring were collected after emergence from the gravel. Microsatellite genetic markers were used to assign parentage of each offspring, and the parents were also typed at the major histocompatibility class IIB locus (MHC). We found that large males, and males with brighter coloration and a more green/blue hue on their lateral integument sired more offspring, albeit only body size and brightness had independent effects. There was no similar relationship between these variables and female reproductive success. Furthermore, there was no effect of sex ratio on the strength or significance of any of the correlations. Females mated non-randomly at the MHC, appearing to select mates that produced offspring with greater genetic diversity as measured by amino-acid divergence. Females mated randomly with respect to male genetic relatedness and males mated randomly with respect to both MHC and genetic relatedness. These results indicate that sexual selection favours increased body size and perhaps integument coloration in males as well as increases genetic diversity at the MHC by female mate choice. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.",Fitness | Major histocompatibility complex | Mate choice | Reproductive success | Salmon | Sexual selection,68,1,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

To investigate whether territorial males eavesdrop on interactions occurring outside of their territory boundaries and to quantify the neighborhood-level effects of song contests, we simulated diurnal dyadic countersinging exchanges in the undefended spaces between established territories of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus). In each of 10 neighborhoods, we used stereo playback to simulate interactions between 2 unknown rivals. We simulated 2 types of song contests that differed only in the relative timing and patterning of the songs of the contestants; aggressive treatments contained frequency matching and song overlapping, whereas submissive treatments contained neither matching nor overlapping. We used a 16-microphone acoustic location system to record males in the neighborhood surrounding the playback apparatus. Territorial chickadees responded more intensely to the aggressive treatments than the submissive treatments. Neighborhood song output (number of songs produced by all individuals in the recording area) was twice as high after aggressive playback than after submissive playback. Males with territories bordering the playback apparatus had higher song output than males who were more than one territory removed from the playback apparatus. We did not find an influence of male dominance rank on playback responses. Our results reveal that territorial male chickadees eavesdrop on and respond to interactions occurring outside of their territory boundaries. © The Author 2008.

We extracted DNA from sympatrically occurring steelhead and rainbow trout collected from five major drainages in British Columbia. We used three types of genetic markers to test for differentiation within the sympatric population: microsatellite DNA markers, gene intron polymorphisms (restriction fragment length polymorphisms [RFLPs] and fragment size polymorphisms), and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) exon polymorphisms (RFLPs). The migratory and resident forms were genetically differentiated in only one sympatric population based on microsatellite data, but no significant differentiation was found using the combined gene locus marker data. Overall, most of the observed allele variation at all marker types was attributable to among-drainage variance, while migratory life history contributed a nonsignificant component based on hierarchical analysis of molecular variance. Interestingly, the migratory and resident forms were genetically differentiated in two different populations based on the gonadotropin and p53 intron polymorphisms, while no significant genetic differentiation was found between the two migratory types at any of the MHC exon or growth hormone intron-length polymorphisms. Furthermore, the neighbor-joining cluster dendrogram based on the microsatellite markers reflected geographic patterns, while the neighbor-joining dendrogram using gene intron and MHC markers did not. Our data indicate that the migratory and resident life histories have probably evolved independently in different drainages in British Columbia. The disagreement between the results of the analyses using the microsatellite and gene locus markers probably reflects differences in selection, mutation, or both, acting at these two types of marker loci. © Copyright by the American Fisheries Society 2008.",,26,0,,undefined,"Ministry of Education, British Columbia"

The increased wavelength is especially problematic for fish because of the relatively small space between their two ears, making interaural comparisons difficult. We presented round goby with conspecific calls, two heterospecific calls (Padogobius bonelli and Gobius niger), white noise and a 100 Hz tone burst to ascertain the effects of sound structure on localization abilities. The round goby has no obvious hearing specializations, causing theory to predict that it should not be able to localize sounds. In the laboratory, fish were presented with a silent speaker and a speaker playing one sound of interest and their behavioural response was quantified. In all trials except those using Gobius niger calls, fish preferentially selected the playing speaker over the silent but the intensity of this response differed with sound type. When the round goby call was played, fish came closer to the speaker and swam faster when responding. Also, the ability to directionalize the sound, measured by examining the path taken to the speaker, was significantly better when the conspecific call was played than when other sounds were presented. While it is still unclear how the round goby is able to directionalize the conspecific call, it appears clear they can directionalize, and possibly localize, conspecific calls as well as differentiate between call types. © 2008 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.",auditory signalling | black goby | communication | Gobius niger | Italian goby | Neogobius melanostomus | Padogobius bonelli | round goby | sensory ecology | sound localization,28,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

The populations span two major drainages comprising the Caroni and the Oropouche, and include sites that are characterized by either high or low predation. Across the populations the frequency of multiple paternity is high with 95% (range: 70%-100%) of broods having multiple sires. Broods have an average of 3.5 sires (range: 1-9) and a mixed-model analysis suggests that broods from high predation sites have marginally more sires than do those from low predation sites, but this is true only in the Oropouche drainage. There is no difference in sire number between predation sites in the Caroni drainage. Brood size, but not female body length, is correlated with the number of sires and the correlation cannot be attributed solely to the stochastic process associated with sperm competition and a 'fair raffle'. Within broods there is significant skew in reproductive success among males, which may reflect variation in sperm competitiveness or female choice. There is, however, no difference in the skew among populations from different predation regimes or drainages. Finally, high predation populations were characterized by increased genetic variability at the microsatellite loci, suggesting a larger effective population size.

During countersinging interactions in songbirds, males vary the type and timing of songs with respect to their opponent's behaviour. In black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, frequency matching and song overlapping appear to be important in territory defence and mate attraction. We studied frequency matching and overlapping behaviour during 100 naturally occurring diurnal song contests among male chickadees using an Acoustic Location System (ALS). The ALS consisted of 16 microphones that recorded countersinging interactions across multiple territories simultaneously, allowing us to triangulate the position of individuals based on delays in sound arrival at each microphone. We used the ALS to record 10 neighbourhoods of chickadees whose relative dominance status had been tabulated during the preceding winter. In 80% of contests there was at least one instance of overlapping between the contestants. In 37% of contests, the contestants were frequency matched within 50 Hz. Neither overlapping nor matching occurred at levels different from those expected by chance. However, contests that contained frequency matching had significantly more instances of overlapping than nonmatched contests. There were no rank-related differences in the proportion of opponents' songs that were frequency matched or overlapped.

Recent studies in songbirds and other species have indicated that non-gonadal sex steroids may also be important. For example, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) - a sex steroid precursor that can be synthesized in the adrenal glands and/or brain - can be converted into active sex steroids, such as 17β-estradiol (E2), within the brain. Here, we examine plasma DHEA and E2 levels in wild developing European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), from hatch (P0) to fledging (P20). Blood samples were collected from either the brachial vein (n = 143) or the jugular vein (n = 129). In songbirds, jugular plasma is enriched with neurally-synthesized steroids and, therefore, jugular plasma is an indirect measure of the neural steroidal milieu. Interestingly, brachial DHEA levels were higher in males than females at P4. In contrast, jugular DHEA levels were higher in females than males at P0 and P10. Brachial E2 levels were higher in males than females at P6. Surprisingly, jugular E2 levels were not high and showed no sex differences. Also, we calculated the difference between brachial and jugular steroid levels. At several ages, jugular steroid levels were lower than brachial levels, particularly in males, suggesting greater neural metabolism of circulating DHEA and E2 in males than females. At a few ages, jugular steroid levels were higher than brachial levels, suggesting neural secretion of DHEA or E2 into the general circulation.

In contrast, we know little about seasonal variation in female signals or signals produced jointly by males and females, such as the vocal duets of birds. Here, we examine how singing behaviour changes in relation to time of year and breeding stage in rufous-and-white wrens (Thryothorus rufalbus), neotropical songbirds where both males and females sing and where breeding partners coordinate songs to produce vocal duets. We recorded a colour-marked population of birds over an extended time period encompassing multiple breeding stages. Across all time frames and breeding stages, males sang at higher rates than females and male solos were more common than duets or female solos. Males and females showed divergent seasonal patterns of singing. Females sang more often early in the year, during the pre-breeding season, and female song tapered off as the breeding season progressed. Duetting followed a parallel pattern, which resulted from females showing less duet responsiveness to their partner's songs later in the year. Male independent song rate peaked at the onset of the rainy season - a time when females become fertile - and males showed the highest level of duet responsiveness during this period. Our results suggest that early in the year, duets appear to be cooperative displays, functioning in joint territory defence and/or the coordination of breeding activities. When females are fertile, however, increased duet responsiveness by males is consistent with mate or paternity guarding. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",Acoustic signals | Duets | Female song | Rufous-and-white wrens | Vocal communication,45,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

Not all wildlife, however, treat tourists as predators; animals can respond positively to tourists, especially when food is used as an attractant. We investigate the costs posed by novel grouping over a tourism-provisioned food resource in a normally solitary forager, the southern stingray Dasyatis americana, in Grand Cayman. Specifically, we test the hypotheses that group-living stingrays in a new environment - which includes both the presence of tourists and quickly renewing food patches - will be exposed to increased injuries, ecto-dermal parasites and aggressive interference competition that result from the unusual grouping behaviour. We found that, in comparison to stingrays from non-tourist sites, tourist-fed stingrays are more likely to have lower body condition, be injured by boats and predators, be susceptible to ecto-dermal parasites, and be engaged in intense interference competition (in the form of conspecific bite marks). Stingrays from tourist sites also have significantly higher mean numbers of injuries, parasites, and median bite marks. By exploring alternative hypotheses to explain the pattern of our findings (e.g. natural causes/behaviour), we unequivocally show that the impacts incurred by the stingrays stem from the effects of tourism. These findings suggest that novel grouping poses costs to the stingrays; the tourist site represents a riskier habitat with regards to injury and predation; and there may be long-term fitness consequences. From a management perspective, measures should be taken to alleviate the crowded conditions at tourist sites, in terms of both boat and stingray density. © Inter-Research 2008.",Aggression | Grouping costs | Injury | Parasites | Predation risk | Stingray | Tourism,58,1,,undefined,

Invasion ecologists increasingly have utilized phylogeographical patterns of mitochondrial or chloroplast DNA sequence variation to link introduced populations with putative source populations. However, many studies have ignored lessons from population genetics and community ecology and are vulnerable to sampling errors owing to insufficient field collections. A review of published invasion studies that utilized mitochondrial or chloroplast DNA markers reveals that insufficient sampling could strongly influence results and interpretations. Sixty per cent of studies sampled an average of less than six individuals per source population, vs. only 45% for introduced populations. Typically, far fewer introduced than source populations were surveyed, although they were sampled more intensively. Simulations based on published data forming a comprehensive mtDNA haplotype data set highlight and quantify the impact of the number of individuals surveyed per source population and number of putative source populations surveyed for accurate assignment of introduced individuals. Errors associated with sampling a low number of individuals are most acute when rare source haplotypes are dominant or fixed in the introduced population. Accuracy of assignment of introduced individuals is also directly related to the number of source populations surveyed and to the degree of genetic differentiation among them (FST). Incorrect interpretations resulting from sampling errors can be avoided if sampling design is considered before field collections are made. © 2008 The Authors.",Chloroplast DNA | Exotic species | Mitochondrial DNA | Nonindigenous species | Phylogeography | Sampling bias,127,0,,undefined,

A comparative and morphological analysis of setae found on the major chelae of reproductive (form I) and non-reproductive (form II) male crayfish, Orconectes rusticus was performed in order to elucidate the distribution and function of smooth and plumose setae. In particular, the distribution of setae between reproductive forms was quantified as well as putative sensory functions, based on morphological characteristics, for both smooth and plumose setae. To accomplish these goals, scanning electron microscopy, a porosity assay, anterograde labeling, and acetylated tubulin (AT) immunocytochemistry were used. We found that form I crayfish have significantly more pockets of sensory setae and individual smooth setae on their major chelae when compared to form II males. Scanning electron microscopy revealed a terminal apical pore-like structure in smooth setae that was absent in plumose setae. Congruent with this finding, smooth setae absorbed crystal violet stain and DiI which labeled putative neural fibers. Conversely, plumose setae did not show any crystal violet or DiI staining. Furthermore, smooth setae contain fiber-like processes that are AT-immunoreactive and are located below the chitinous exoskeleton of the chelae. These fibers extend from the base of the smooth setae to the pore-like structure located at the distal tip. AT-immunoreactive fibers were not present in plumose setae. These results imply that smooth setae on the major chelae are putative chemoreceptors and plumose setae may serve a mechanosensory function. Coupled with previous behavioral studies, these results suggest that a dimorphism in the major chelae, found between male reproductive forms, enhances sensory perception during reproductive behaviors.",Acetylated tubulin | Crayfish | Crystal violet | Major chelae | Retrograde labeling | Sensory setae,8,1,,undefined,

Biomagnification refers to the condition where the chemical concentration in an organism exceeds the concentration of its food when the major exposure route occurs from the organism's diet. The term food web biomagnification is used to describe trophic enrichment of contaminants within food webs and refers to the progressive increase in chemical concentrations with increasing animal trophic status. For hydrophobic organic contaminants, the terms biomagnification and food web biomagnification are more narrowly defined to reflect the thermodynamic condition where the chemical potential in an animal exceeds its diet and environment and increases through successive trophic levels. The first empirical data demonstrating food web biomagnification was generated for the chlorinated insecticide dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane in plankton, fish, and birds from Clear Lake, California following multiple applications of the pesticide in the 1950s. Food web biomagnification for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane was well established for multiple aquatic systems by the 1960s, although it was not until the 1980s that the thermodynamic criteria of biomagnification was tested and validated using field data. A number of mechanisms have been proposed to account for biomagnification. The gastrointestinal magnification model and recent amendments to this model are outlined as well as alternative, nondietary, mechanisms that can lead to similar and potentially confounding observations of biomagnification.",Bioaccumulation | Bioconcentration | Biological amplification | Biological magnification | Chemical trophodynamics | Contaminant assimilation | Contaminant uptake | Ecological magnification | Persistent organic pollutants | Trophic magnification,3,0,,undefined,

Because recovery of the body can be hampered by the degree of scatter due to scavengers, the methods used to search for body parts will influence how much is found and the length of time taken to recover the body. We compared the frequency of scavenging by vertebrates in two different habitats, a deciduous forest and a tall grass meadow, and measured the time taken to search for scattered remains within a designated search area using four methods. Freshly killed 23 kg pigs were placed in either a forest or tall grass meadow habitat, and scavenging by vertebrates was observed over a 5–6 day period. Subsequently, the link, line, zone, and spiral methods were used to search for remains within a 21 m2 search area. Three of 5 pigs in the forest and 4 of 5 pigs in the meadow habitat were scavenged by a variety of vertebrates. Mean time to search the designated area around each pig differed between the forest and the meadow, but not by search method.

Since these systems are largely heterotrophic, treeholes are dependent on the surrounding terrestrial ecosystem for their basal energy input. In this study, we observed a cyclic succession of three system states in a water-filled Fagus grandifolia treehole: 'connected' during rainfall; 'isolated' during periods without rain; and 'dry' when no freestanding water was present. During the isolated phase, a rapid, microbially mediated turn-over of nitrogen and sulphate took place, coincident with an accumulation of orthophosphate. Ammonium was the dominant form of nitrogen in the treehole water, and a net decrease in its concentration was observed when the water volume decreased. Normally, nitrate concentration showed only minor fluctuations (0.3-1.3 mg l-1) and concentrations of nitrite were very low (3-18 μg l -1). Concentration of sulphate showed a net decrease, coincident with an increase in sulphide. During the connected phase, the effect of stemflow and throughfall on the nutrient concentrations in the treehole water proved to be variable. Over time, both dilution of, and increase in, treehole water nutrient concentrations were observed. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration showed a net decrease during the isolated phase. Spring coarse particulate organic matter input into the treehole was variable (0.20-1.74 mg cm -2week-1). The observed variability in precipitation inputs as well as fall-in of organic matter underlines the pulsed character of basal energy entering the treehole food-web. DOC concentrations varied mainly with depth (15-57.4 mg l-1) as concentrations were almost three times greater within the detritus than within the water column. Bacterial abundances ranged from 7.3 × 105 to 9.3 × 106 cells ml-1 and did not appear to vary within the water column or in the detrital sediment. Rates of bacterial production increased 24 h after rain events, suggesting that the combined nutrient fluxes due to increased stemflow stimulate the microbial community. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Bacterial production | Carbon cycling | Nutrient dynamics | Phytotelmata | Temporary waters | Treehole food-webs,6,0,WUR,undefined,Wageningen University and Research Centre

Recent studies reveal that suboscine song may be more variable and complex than previously realized. Several suboscine species show marked individual variation in their songs-variation that may play a role in individual recognition and neighbor-stranger discrimination-and a few suboscine species show indications of song learning. We investigated individual variation in the vocalizations of a suboscine passerine, the Screaming Piha (Lipaugus vociferans), from recordings of 26 males at four lek sites along the Tambopata River in Peru. Male Screaming Piha songs consist of quiet introductory syllables followed by two explosively loud syllables that sound like an emphatic pee haw. We used three complementary methods to examine variation in song characteristics. Spectrogram cross-correlation revealed significant consistency within individual males and variability among males. Analysis of fine structural characteristics revealed that all measured song features were significantly less variable within individuals than among individuals. Canonical discriminant analysis based on these 13 song features correctly classified 93.2% of songs by individual and 76.4% of songs by lek site. Our results indicate that there is sufficient consistency in song features within males and sufficient variation among males for identification of individuals on the basis of songs and, to a lesser extent, that song features vary with the lek site of the singer. We conclude that Screaming Pihas sing songs that are individually distinctive and bear a lek signature. © 2008 by The American Ornithologists' Union.

In birds, the maternal transfer of corticosterone to eggs was recently proposed as a hormonal mechanism by which offspring phenotype is matched to the relative quality of the maternal environment. However, current hypotheses lack supporting information on both intra- and inter-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone for wild birds. As such, we examined variation in yolk corticosterone levels in a wild population of European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris). Maternal condition, clutch size and nesting density were all negatively related to yolk corticosterone deposition; females with high condition indices, those laying larger clutches and those nesting in high-density associations deposited lower amounts of the hormone into eggs than those with low condition indices, laying small clutches and nesting in isolation. Alternatively, we found no effects of maternal age or human disturbance on yolk corticosterone deposition. Intra-clutch variation of yolk corticosterone was significant, with levels increasing across the laying sequence in all clutch sizes examined, with the difference between first and last-laid eggs being greater in large versus small clutches. Given the reported effects of yolk corticosterone on offspring size and growth, intra-clutch variation in yolk corticosterone has the potential to alter the competitive environment within a brood. Furthermore, our results indicate that variation in yolk corticosterone can originate from variation in both the mother's quality as well as the quality of her breeding environment.

Discovered in 1946 and ""red-listed"" by the IUCN since 1988, Niceforo's Wren faces a threat of extinction because of its limited habitat range and increasing deforestation for agriculture and livestock. This species has been poorly studied, and its vocal behavior is yet undescribed. We provide the first description of the vocalizations of Niceforo's Wren, based on analyses of recordings from 29 individuals (more than half of all estimated living individuals of this species). We examined the fine structure of their songs, the pattern of solo and duet singing behavior, and the song repertoire size of males and females. Both sexes produce solo songs, coordinated vocal duets, and a variety of calls. Songs have a stereotyped syntax including one or more introductory syllables, a trill of rapidly repeated syllables, and a frequency-modulated terminal syllable. Males have a repertoire of at least 12-21 different song types, whereas females have a repertoire of at least 7-9. Both sexes sing solo songs with eventual variety. Male songs are more complex and have lower frequency characteristics, whereas female songs are shorter, with fewer syllable types and fewer syllable repeats. Duets involve mated pairs singing in a coordinated fashion using the same song types from their solo repertoires. Duets typically begin with a male song followed by a female song and show variable levels of complexity involving one to two songs given by each individual. Our results provide a foundation for monitoring Niceforo's Wrens and facilitating conservation of this critically endangered species. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2008.",Colombia | Conservation | Duet | Neotropical dry forest | Niceforo's Wren,7,0,,undefined,

Like many passerine birds, Black-capped Chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) have a short average adult life-expectancy (∼2 years); however, the maximum recorded life span is >5× as long. Enhanced annual survival could contribute to greater lifetime reproductive success for male Black-capped Chickadees with high social rank. We used multistate capture-mark-recapture models to estimate annual survival of male Black-capped Chickadees in Ontario using resighting and recapture data collected from 1997 to 2002. Our goal was to evaluate support for an influence of rank on annual survival and estimate its effect size for a food-supplemented study site. We also statistically modeled the probability of between-year rank transitions. Model selection based on Akaike's information criterion provided support for an effect of rank on survival. However, multimodel inference revealed that the size of the effect was rather small. Over the six study years, model-averaged estimates of the survival benefit of high versus low rank ranged from 5.0 to 7.3%. As expected, survival was strongly year-dependent, with model-averaged estimates of annual survival probability varying between 0.36 and 0.73. Age was an important predictor of the probability of rank transitions. Low-ranked second-year birds were less likely than older low-ranked birds to advance to high rank between years; likewise, high-ranked after-second-year birds were less likely to drop in rank. Other studies have found larger effects of rank on survival than we observed here. Future research should consider how interactions between social and environmental factors influence annual survival. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2008.",Age-specific mortality | Black-capped Chickadee | Capture-mark-recapture models | Paridae | Poecile atricapillus | Rank acquisition | Social dominance,10,0,,undefined,

Lake Matano exhibits weak thermal stratification, yet a persistent pycnocline separates an oxic epilimnion from anoxic meta- and hypolimnions. The concentration of soluble P in the epilimnetic waters is very low and can be attributed to scavenging by Fe (hydr)oxides. Chromium concentrations in the epilimnion are high (up to 180 nmol L -1), but below U.S. Environmental Protection Agency guidelines for aquatic ecosystems. The concentration of chromium decreases sharply across the oxic-anoxic boundary, revealing that the hypolimnion is a sink for Cr. Flux calculations using a one-dimensional transport-reaction model for the water column fail to satisfy mass balance requirements and indicate that sediment transport and diagenesis play an important role in the exchange of Fe, Mn, P, and Cr between the epilimnion and hypolimnion. Exchange of water between the epilimnion and hypolimnion is slow and on a time scale similar to temperate meromictic lakes. This limits recycling of P and N to the epilimnion and removal of Cr to the hypolimnion, both of which likely restrict primary production in the epilimnion. Owing to the slow exchange, steep concentration gradients in Fe and Mn species develop in the metalimnion. These concentration gradients are conducive to the proliferation of chemoautotrophic and anoxygenic phototrophic microbial communities, which may contribute a significant fraction to the total primary production in the lake. © 2008, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,59,0,,undefined,

The initiation of locomotion, on the other hand, relies on supraspinal networks and the cellular mechanisms involved are only beginning to be understood. This review examines some of the findings relative to the neural mechanisms involved in the initiation of locomotion of lampreys. Locomotion can be elicited by sensory stimulation or by internal cues associated with fundamental needs of the animal such as food seeking, exploration, and mating. We have described mechanisms by which escape swimming is elicited in lampreys in response to mechanical skin stimulation. A rather simple neural connectivity is involved, including sensory and relay neurons, as well as the brainstem rhombencephalic reticulospinal cells, which act as command neurons. We have shown that reticulospinal cells have intrinsic membrane properties that allow them to transform a short duration sensory input into a long-lasting excitatory command that activates the spinal locomotor networks. These mechanisms constitute an important feature for the activation of escape swimming. Other sensory inputs can also elicit locomotion in lampreys. For instance, we have recently shown that olfactory signals evoke sustained depolarizations in reticulospinal neurons and chemical activation of the olfactory bulbs with local injections of glutamate induces fictive locomotion. The mechanisms by which internal cues initiate locomotion are less understood. Our research has focused on one particular locomotor center in the brainstem, the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR). The MLR is believed to channel inputs from many brain regions to generate goal-directed locomotion. It activates reticulospinal cells to elicit locomotor output in a graded fashion contrary to escape locomotor bouts, which are all-or-none. MLR inputs to reticulospinal cells use both glutamatergic and cholinergic transmission; nicotinic receptors on reticulospinal cells are involved. MLR excitatory inputs to reticulospinal cells in the middle (MRRN) are larger than those in the posterior rhombencephalic reticular nucleus (PRRN). Moreover at low stimulation strength, reticulospinal cells in the MRRN are activated first, whereas those in the PRRN require stronger stimulation strengths. The output from the MLR on one side activates reticulospinal neurons on both sides in a highly symmetrical fashion. This could account for the symmetrical bilateral locomotor output evoked during unilateral stimulation of the MLR in all animal species tested to date. Interestingly, muscarinic receptor activation reduces sensory inputs to reticulospinal neurons and, under natural conditions, the activation of MLR cholinergic neurons will likely reduce sensory inflow. Moreover, exposing the brainstem to muscarinic agonists generates sustained recurring depolarizations in reticulospinal neurons through pre-reticular effects. Cells in the caudal half of the rhombencephalon appear to be involved and we propose that the activation of these muscarinoceptive cells could provide additional excitation to reticulospinal cells when the MLR is activated under natural conditions. One important question relates to sources of inputs to the MLR. We found that substance P excites the MLR, whereas GABA inputs tonically maintain the MLR inhibited and removal of this inhibition initiates locomotion. Other locomotor centers exist such as a region in the ventral thalamus projecting directly to reticulospinal cells. This region, referred to as the diencephalic locomotor region, receives inputs from several areas in the forebrain and is likely important for goal-directed locomotion. In summary, this review focuses on the most recent findings relative to initiation of lamprey locomotion in response to sensory and internal cues in lampreys. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

A stratified random sampling design was used to measure the spatial patterns of metal inputs, settling and sorting along the length of the Corridor. Factors regulating metal mobilization were assessed by determining metal affinities with the total organic fraction (TOM), the mineral fraction (represented as Al), and the granulometric characteristic (represented as <0.063 mm fraction). The study revealed that anthropogenic factors primarily regulated metal distributions and mobilization throughout the Huron-Erie Corridor. In the St. Clair and Detroit Rivers, the spatial pattern of metal distributions strongly reflected local industrial sources. In the Walpole Delta and Lake St. Clair, however, inorganic (clays) and organic (TOM) particles dominated the contaminant distribution.

Here, we report the discovery of a second Frq-encoding gene (frq2) in Drosophila. The temporal and spatial expression patterns of the two genes are very similar, and the proteins they encode, Frq1 and Frq2, are 95% identical in amino acid sequence. Frq1 is more abundant than Frq2, and is most highly expressed in larva. Loss-of-function phenotypes were studied using dominant negative peptides to prevent Frq target binding, RNAi to reduce gene transcription, or both methods. To discriminate chronic from acute loss-of-function effects, we compared the effects of transgenic expression and forward-filling the dominant-negative peptide into presynaptic terminals. In both cases, a 70% reduction in quantal content per bouton occurred, demonstrating that this trait does not result from homeostatic adaptations of the synapse during development. The chronic treatment also produced more synaptic boutons from MNSNb/d-Is motorneurons, but fewer active zones per bouton. By contrast, excess-of-function conditions yielded a 1.4- to 2-fold increase in quantal content and fewer boutons in the same motorneuron. These synaptic effects resulted in behavioural changes in the Buridan locomotion assay, showing that walking speed is dependent on Frq activity in the nervous system. All the effects were identical for both Frqs, and consistent with excess- and loss-of-function genotypes. We conclude that Frqs have two distinct functions: one in neurotransmission, regulating the probability of release per synapse, and another in axonal growth and bouton formation. © The Authors (2007).",Drosophila | Neuromuscular junction | Presynaptic regulation | Quantal content,26,0,,undefined,

Interestingly, although avian nestlings experience multiple resource-based physiological trade-offs and undergo considerable morphological and physiological changes during postnatal development, there is no data available on how nestlings manage the competing demands of growth and the development of flight ability at this critical life-history stage. We examined numerous morphological traits to determine which are responsible for variation in flight performance in juvenile European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris), a sexually size-dimorphic passerine. We then manipulated maternal quality during chick rearing (via feather clipping) to examine sex-specific sensitivity of fledgling flight performance to the quality of the rearing environment. Results suggest that the mechanics underlying variation in juvenile flight performance are relatively simple, being principally determined by the ratio of pectoral muscle mass to body mass (BM) and the surface area of the wings. Interestingly, although the maternal quality manipulation decreased BM and structural size in daughters, only the flight performance of sons was negatively affected. Our results suggest that a survival-related trait can be significantly affected in the larger sex when raised under stressful conditions.

""Stingray City Sandbar"" in the Cayman Islands, where visitors can hand feed free-ranging Southern Stingrays (Dasyatis americana), is a world-famous attraction currently undergoing visitor and wildlife management. One plan is to decrease the amount of nonnatural food provided by tourists with the intention of decreasing stingray habituation to the artificial food source and promoting stingray health. However, the effectiveness of this action is uncertain given that neither the extent of squid composition in the stingray diet nor the degree of nutrient similarity between the fed and natural diets is unknown. We used fatty acid (FA) profile analysis to address these questions by assessing the serum nonesterified FA composition of fed and unfed stingrays around the island and compared them with FA profiles of (1) the provisioned food source (squid) and (2) other warm- and cold-water elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). Our results indicated that fed stingrays were distinct. The FA profiles of the fed stingray population were expressly different from those of the unfed populations and showed a remarkable similarity to the FA composition of squid, suggesting that squid is the main food source. The tropical fed stingrays also exhibited essential FA ratios, specific to both species and habitat, comparable with those of elasmobranchs and squid from cold-water environs, implying that the provisioned food does not provide a similar nutritional lipid composition to that eaten in the wild. Our results suggest that FA profiles are a valuable indicator for the management and monitoring of fed Southern Stingrays because they can be used to assess differences in diet composition and provide an index of nutritional similarity. Our findings are currently being used by Caymanian stakeholders in designing practical management actions for their wildlife attraction. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,38,0,,undefined,

We applied this method to the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis), a catadromous crustacean with a long history of invasion in Europe. We used genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction to predict the potential European distribution of mitten crab based on its distribution in 42 locations in its native Asia. The climatic variables, air temperature, number of days, amount of precipitation, and wetness index, contributed significantly to predictions of native distribution limits. Although the genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction model was developed for the native range, the species' extensive distribution in Europe (n = 434) allowed independent validation of the predictions. Application of the model to Europe was successful, with 84% of occurrences in regions predicted to be suitable by >80% of the models and <4% of occurrences in areas predicted suitable by <50% of the models (mainly along the northern range). At the watershed scale, areas with established mitten crab populations had significantly higher habitat matching than sites that were not invaded. The independent validation of the Asian-based model by the European distribution revealed that predictions were highly accurate. The model also identified large areas of Europe, particularly along the Mediterranean coast, as vulnerable to future invasion. These predictions can be used to develop strategies to control the spread of mitten crab by preventing introductions into vulnerable areas. © 2007 Society for Conservation Biology.",Chinese mitten crab | Ecological niche modeling | Eriocheir sinensis | Genetic algorithm for rule-set prediction | Habitat matching | Nonindigenous species | Species dispersal,41,0,,undefined,

Significant differences in PCB congener depuration were observed among the three size classes with negligible elimination of congeners of the octanol-water partition coefficient (log K ow) > 6.5 occurring for the two larger size classes. Over the winter months, medium and large perch eliminated PCB 19 only, the least hydrophobic congener, with no elimination of PCBs of log Kow > 5.8 observed for the smallest individuals. An increase in lipid-normalized PCB concentrations was observed during the overwinter period because of the depletion of lipids as an energetic reserve. For medium and large perch, this increase was sufficient to overwhelm any elimination achieved during the spring and summer seasons.

The rats were trained to withdraw from a drinking spout to avoid a shock when they detected a modulation of the sound. Sensitivity was evaluated by testing the rats at progressively smaller depths of modulation. Psychophysical curves were produced to describe the limits of detection at modulation rates of 10, 100 and 1000 Hz. Performance scores were based on the probability of withdrawal from the spout during AM (warning periods) relative to withdrawal during the un-modulated noise (safe periods). A threshold was defined as the depth of modulation that produced a score halfway between perfect avoidance and no avoidance (performance score = 0.5). Bilateral auditory cortical lesions resulted in significant elevations in threshold for detection of AM at rates of 100 and 1000 Hz. No significant shift was found at a modulation rate of 10 Hz. The magnitude of the deficit for AM rates of 100 and 1000 Hz was positively correlated with the size of the cortical lesion. Substantial deficits were found only in animals with lesions that included secondary as well as primary auditory cortical areas. The results show that the rat's auditory cortex is important for processing sinusoidal AM and that its contribution is most apparent at high modulation rates. The data suggest that the auditory cortex is a crucial structure for maintaining normal sensitivity to temporal modulation of an auditory stimulus. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

However, recent studies in avian species that exhibit moderate size-dimorphism indicate that the smaller sex may be more sensitive to poor rearing conditions. To better understand sex-specific sensitivity in a passerine exhibiting moderate size-dimorphism, we examined growth, cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and survival of European starling Sturnus vulgaris nestlings following an experimental reduction of maternal rearing ability (via a feather-clipping manipulation). Contrary to conventional theory, daughters showed reduced growth in both body mass and measures of structural size in response to the maternal treatment. In contrast, sons showed no reductions in any of these traits in relation to the treatment. No sex-specific differences in nestling CMI were found for either group, although CMI of nestlings raised by manipulated mothers were higher than those of control nestlings. Finally, fledging sex ratios did not change from those at hatching indicating that neither sex appeared differentially sensitive to the maternal treatment in terms of mortality. These results reveal that variation in the quality of the rearing environment can have significant effects on the smaller sex of a passerine exhibiting moderate dimorphism and as such support recent studies of species with small-moderate sexual size-dimorphism. Combined results suggest that sex-specific effects of environmental variation on nestling development may be both context- (i.e., brood size, resource level, hatching order) and temporally- (when during development they occur) specific. Furthermore, more studies are needed that examine multiple traits at several developmental stages and then follow the sexes over the longer-term to examine potential effects on fitness. © Journal of Avian Biology.",,26,0,,undefined,

Eggs were pressure shocked after fertilization to create triploid fish from a subset of each family. In June, fish were sampled for size, plasma insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), gill Na+-K+-ATPase activity, and expression of two Na+-K+-ATPase α subunits in the gill. Diploids were significantly heavier than triploids, and there were significant differences due to family.

Furthermore, Spy1 protected cyclin E/CDK2 from p27 inhibition toward histone H1, in vitro. Inducible Spy1 expres-sion in U2OS cells reduced levels of endogenous p27 and exogenous p27WT, but not a p27T187A mutant. Additionally, Spy1 expression in synchronized HeLa cells enhanced T187 phosphorylation and degradation of endogenous p27 in late G1 and throughout S-phase. Our studies provide evidence that Spy1 expression enhances CDK2-dependent p27 degradation during late G1 and throughout S-phase. ©2007 Landes Bioscience.",Cancer | Cdc2 | CDK2 | Cell cycle | Cyclin-dependent kinase | p27Kip1 | RINGO | Speedy,26,1,,undefined,

Here, we demonstrate an approach for evaluating the relative influence of geography, geomorphology and human disturbance on patterns of variation in biotic indicators derived from multiple assemblages for ecosystems that span broad spatial scales. To accomplish this, we collected abundance information on six biotic assemblages (birds, fish, amphibians, aquatic macroinvertebrates, wetland vegetation, and diatoms) from over 450 locations along U.S. shorelines throughout each of the Great Lakes during 2002-2004. Sixty-six candidate taxon- and function-based indicators analyzed using hierarchical variance partitioning revealed that geographic (lake) rather than geomorphic factors (wetland type) had the greatest influence on the proportion of variance explained across all indicators, and that a significant portion of the variance was also related to response to human disturbance. Wetland vegetation, fish and bird indicators were the most, and macroinvertebrates the least, responsive to human disturbance. Proportion of rock bass, Carex lasiocarpa, and stephanodiscoid diatoms, as well as the presence of spring peepers and the number of insectivorous birds were among the indicators that responded most strongly to a human disturbance index, suggesting they have good potential as indicators of Great Lakes coastal wetland condition. Ecoprovince, wetland type, and indicator type (taxa vs function based) explained relatively little variance. Variance patterns for macroinvertebrates and birds were least concordant with those of other assemblages, while diatoms and amphibians, and fish and wetland vegetation were the most concordant assemblage pairs. Our results strongly suggest it will not be possible to develop effective indicators of Great Lakes coastal wetland condition without accounting for differences among lakes and their important interactions.

These chemicals represented a range of whole-body half-lives of 82-265 days in the gull. Dietary intake of POPs by a female gull was simulated by a dynamic bioenergetics model which included dependence on temperature, photoperiod, egg production, and feeding chicks. Concentrations in the two main prey fish of the gull in Lake Ontario were used for POP exposure. Clearance from the female was based on a two compartment toxicokinetic model. Egg concentrations were estimated from egg/whole body female concentration ratios. Simulated concentrations were compared to measured concentrations in gull eggs from 4 different colonies in the northern part of Lake Ontario. Simulations using a diet of 81% fish and 19% uncontaminated food resulted in the best fit with least variance among predicted and measured data. The mean ratio of predicted to measured concentrations in eggs was 1.0 ± 0.27 among chemicals, years, and colonies for this exposure scenario. This result was in excellent agreement with field assessments of herring gull diet composition in Lake Ontario of 80-82% fish. The ability to perform accurate a priori simulations for the range of test conditions employed in the validation constituted a rigorous test of the soundness of the model's structure and parameterization.

These programs typically mate individuals randomly and as such they overlook the importance of genetic quality to offspring fitness and ultimately to ensuring population health. Here, we use Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and a fully crossed quantitative genetic breeding design to partition genetic variance in offspring performance (growth and survival) to additive and non-additive genetic effects as well as maternal effects. We show that these three effects contribute about equally to the variation in survival, but only non-additive genetic and maternal effects contribute to variation in growth. Some of the genetic effects could be assigned to variation at the class IIB locus of the major histocompatibility complex, but the maternal effects were not associated with egg size and we found no relationship between dam phenotypic measures and offspring survival or growth. We also found no relationship between sire sexually selected characters and offspring survival or growth, which is inconsistent with a ""good genes"" hypothesis. Finally, we show that incorporation of genetic quality into supportive breeding programs can increase offspring growth or survival by between 3% and 19% during the endogenous feeding stage alone, and projections to adulthood suggest that survivorship could be over four fold higher. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.",Chinook salmon | Compatible genes | Genetic quality | Good genes | Major histocompatibility complex | Mate choice | Supportive breeding,73,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

One possible mechanism of dispersal to inland lakes occurs via fouling of and subsequent transfer on sport fishing lines. Here we explore fouling of Cercopagis on different commercial brands of fishing lines while trolling on Lake Ontario. Accumulation of animals varied significantly across brands, and was lowest on Flea Flicker brand. Fouling was more intense with line set at 20 than at 10 m, and was directly related to the distance trolled. Different pound-tests of Flea Flicker did not vary significantly in Cercopagis accumulation rates. The maximum number of Cercopagis and diapausing stages on a fishing line was 1024 individuals and 106 diapausing eggs. Because diapausing eggs may remain viable for weeks or longer, their transfer on fouled fishing line to non-invaded lakes poses a risk of invasion and supports previous studies that suggested sport fishermen as possible vectors of dispersal of invasive waterfleas. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",Cercopagis | Diapausing eggs | Dispersal | Great Lakes | Non-indigenous species,12,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

The aim of this study was to determine if primary production in western Lake Erie had declined as predicted by these original models. Annual primary production, estimated using both in situ and constant light incubations, ranged from 320-370 g C m-2 between 2000 and 2002. The current rate of annual primary production in the west basin was comparable with the 340 g C m-2 reported for 1970 when phosphorus abatement programs were initiated. Phytoplankton standing crop, measured as chlorophyll-a, has declined however, from annual mean (i.e. growing season) concentrations of 12 mg m-3 in 1970 to 4-7 mg m-3 in 2000-2002. Phytoplankton biomass ranged from 4-5 g m-3 in the spring and summer of 2000-2001, similar to the 5-7 g m-3 reported in 1970. Taxonomic analysis of the phytoplankton community, however, revealed an increase in the relative abundance of mesotrophic genera (e.g. Chlamydomonas, Cyclotella, Microcystis) as compared with the more eutrophic assemblage observed in 1970. It is concluded that primary production in the western basin of Lake Erie has not declined as predicted by the original phosphorus-chlorophyll-a-primary production models. Multiple stressor models linking nutrient dynamics to species invasions and subsequent changes in the underwater light climate are required for the future management of primary production in Lake Erie. © 2007 E.

To determine whether contaminants may be playing a role in the population decline of this species, ivory gull eggs collected in 1976, 1987 and 2004 from Seymour Island in the Canadian Arctic were analyzed for organochlorines, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), dibenzofurans (PCDFs) and non-ortho PCBs. This study also provides the first account of polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hexabromocyclododecanes (HBCDs) and polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) in ivory gulls. The most quantitatively abundant legacy organochlorines found in the ivory gull eggs were p,p′-DDE, ΣPCB and oxychlordane. Concentrations of the organochlorines analyzed either decreased or showed little change between 1976 and 2004. Concentrations of ΣPCDD in ivory gull eggs were greater than ΣPCDF, and the non-ortho PCBs (primarily PCB-126) contributed the largest fraction to the total TEQ value in all years sampled. Concentrations of PCDDs, PCDFs and ΣTEQ decreased from 1976 to 2004. In contrast, concentrations of the PBDEs steadily increased between 1976 and 2004 driven primarily by increases in BDE-47. Although concentrations of the persistent chlorinated compounds (i.e. organochlorine pesticides, PCBs, PCDDs, PCDFs) reported in this study were below published toxicological threshold values for eggs of wild birds, we cannot rule out the possibility of synergistic/additive, sublethal effects. Very few studies have been carried out to evaluate the exposure-effect relationship of the persistent brominated compounds in avian species. Given the scarcity of information on toxicity threshold levels for PBBs and PBDEs in avian species, coupled with the trend toward increasing concentrations in ivory gulls, continued monitoring and further toxicological studies of these compounds are warranted. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that adhesive differences determine the association of stem cells with embryonic cells in chimera assays and hence their ability to contribute to later tissues. We show that primitive NSCs and definitive NSCs possess adhesive differences, resulting from differential cadherin expression, that lead to a double dissociation in outcomes after introduction into the early- versus midgestation embryo. Primitive NSCs are able to sort with the cells of the inner cell mass and thus contribute to early embryogenesis, in contrast to definitive NSCs, which cannot. Conversely, primitive NSCs sort away from cells of the embryonic day 9.5 telencephalon and are unable to contribute to neural tissues at midembryogenesis, in contrast to definitive NSCs, which can. Overcoming these adhesive differences by E-cadherin overexpression allows some definitive NSCs to integrate into the inner cell mass but is insufficient to allow them to contribute to later development. These adhesive differences suggest an evolving compartmentalization in multipotent NSCs during development and serve to illustrate the importance of cell- cell association for revealing cellular contribution.

Results reveal that all Telmatherina previously described in this system can be categorized into three mitochondrial lineages and that colouration is only weakly associated with early divergence. Clade-specific body shapes, however, likely adapted to microenvironments are key to the initial divergence in this system.

Our results are consistent with an emerging pattern repeated in many vertebrate radiations, whereby divergence by colouration or other display traits is preceded by specialization to environmental adaptive peaks. © 2007 The Authors.",Adaptive radiation | Colouration | Geometric morphometrics | Initial divergence | Lake Matano | Microenvironments | Radiation in stages | Sexual selection | Sulawesi | Telmatherina,15,0,,undefined,

Control over gill ventilation may be a regulatory mechanism used for odorant sampling during reproductive periods. In this study, we examined changes in gill ventilation in osmic and anosmic (nasal occluded), reproductive and non-reproductive male round gobies to a putative steroidal pheromone estrone (1,3,5(10)-estratrien-3-ol-17-one). We tested 5 different concentrations of estrone (10- 12 to 10- 8 M) and showed that the response threshold for estrone varied with the male's reproductive status; it was 10- 11 M in reproductive males, and rose to 10- 9 M in non-reproductive males. However, anosmic reproductive and non-reproductive males did not respond to estrone. These findings suggest that olfactory responses to putative pheromones may change depending on the reproductive status of the fish. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Chinook salmon families were bred using a paternal half-sib breeding design (62 females and 31 males) and half of each resulting family was treated to induce triploidy. The paired families were used to test for dosage effects (resulting from triploidy) on (1) the distribution and magnitude of phenotypic variation, (2) narrow-sense heritability and (3) maternal effects in fitness-related traits (i.e., survival, size-at-age, relative growth rate and serum lysozyme activity). Quantitative genetic analyses were performed separately for diploid and triploid family groups. Triploidization resulted in significantly higher levels of phenotypic variance and substantial differences in patterns of variance distribution for growth and survival-related traits, although the patterns were reversed for lysozyme activity. Triploids exhibited higher narrow sense heritability values relative to diploid Chinook salmon. However, maternal effects estimates were generally lower in triploids than in diploids. Thus, the dosage effects resulting from adding an extra set of chromosomes to the Chinook salmon genome are primarily additive. Somewhat counterintuitively, however, the relative magnitude of the combined effects of dominance, epistasis and maternal effects is not affected by dosage. Our results indicate that inheritance of fitness-related quantitative traits is profoundly affected by dosage effects associated with induced triploidy, and that triploidization can result in unpredictable performance and fitness outcomes. © 2007 Nature Publishing Group.

Despite the fundamental appeal of a regional approach, development of regional stress measures remains one of the most important current challenges in environmental science. Using publicly available, pre-existing spatial datasets, we developed a geographic information system database of 86 variables related to five classes of anthropogenic stress in the U.S. Great Lakes basin: agriculture, atmospheric deposition, human population, land cover, and point source pollution. The original variables were quantified by a variety of data types over a broad range of spatial and classification resolutions. We summarized the original data for 762 watershed-based units that comprise the U.S. portion of the basin and then used principal components analysis to develop overall stress measures within each stress category. We developed a cumulative stress index by combining the first principal component from each of the five stress categories. Maps of the stress measures illustrate strong spatial patterns across the basin, with the greatest amount of stress occurring on the western shore of Lake Michigan, southwest Lake Erie, and southeastern Lake Ontario. We found strong relationships between the stress measures and characteristics of bird communities, fish communities, and water chemistry measurements from the coastal region. The stress measures are taken to represent the major threats to coastal ecosystems in the U.S. Great Lakes. Such regional-scale efforts are critical for understanding relationships between human disturbance and ecosystem response, and can be used to guide environmental decision-making at both regional and local scales. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",Anthropogenic stress | Coastal ecosystems | GIS | Great Lakes,109,0,,undefined,

We developed and compared two separate environmental niche models using genetic algorithm for rule set prediction (GARP) and mitten crab occurrences in Asia and Europe to predict the species' potential distribution in North America. Since mitten crabs must reproduce in water with ≥15‰ salinity, we limited the potential North American range to freshwater habitats within the highest documented dispersal distance (1260 km) and a more restricted dispersal limit (354 km) from the sea. Applying the higher dispersal distance, both models predicted the lower Great Lakes, most of the eastern seaboard, the Gulf of Mexico and southern extent of the Mississippi River watershed, and the Pacific northwest as suitable environment for mitten crabs, but environmental match for southern states (below 35° N) was much lower for the European model. Use of the lower range with both models reduced the expected range, especially in the Great Lakes, Mississippi drainage, and inland areas of the Pacific Northwest. To estimate the risk of introduction of mitten crabs, the amount of reported ballast water discharge into major United States ports from regions in Asia and Europe with established mitten crab populations was used as an index of introduction effort. Relative risk of invasion was estimated based on a combination of environmental match and volume of unexchanged ballast water received (July 1999-December 2003) for major ports. The ports of Norfolk and Baltimore were most vulnerable to invasion and establishment, making Chesapeake Bay the most likely location to be invaded by mitten crabs in the United States. The next highest risk was predicted for Portland, Oregon. Interestingly, the port of Los Angeles/Long Beach, which has a large shipping volume, had a low risk of invasion. Ports such as Jacksonville, Florida, had a medium risk owing to small shipping volume but high environmental match. This study illustrates that the combination of environmental niche- and vector-based models can provide managers with more precise estimates of invasion risk than can either of these approaches alone. © 2007 by the Ecological Society of America.",Ecological niche modeling | Eriocheir sinensis | Genetic algorithm for rule set prediction (GARP) | Introduced range | Invasive species | Native range | Relative risk | Risk assessment,110,0,,undefined,

There are many similarities in the olfactory systems of all fishes, and they also share characteristics with the olfactory system of mammals.

Using retrograde tracing with dyes injected into the olfactory bulb, we identified three morphotypes which are highly similar to those found in teleosts.

The anaphase-promoting complex (APC) and a conserved APC adaptor, Cdc20 (also known as Fzy), are required for anaphase progression in mitotic cells. The APC has also been implicated in meiosis, although it is not yet understood how it mediates these non-canonical divisions. Cortex (Cort) is a diverged Fzy homologue that is expressed in the female germline of Drosophila, where it functions with the Cdk1-interacting protein Cks30A to drive anaphase in meiosis II. Here, we show that Cort functions together with the canonical mitotic APC adaptor Fzy to target the three mitotic cyclins (A, B and B3) for destruction in the egg and drive anaphase progression in both meiotic divisions. In addition to controlling cyclin destruction globally in the egg, Cort and Fzy appear to both be required for the local destruction of cyclin B on spindles. We find that cyclin B associates with spindle microtubules throughout meiosis I and meiosis II, and dissociates from the meiotic spindle in anaphase II. Fzy and Cort are required for this loss of cyclin B from the meiotic spindle. Our results lead to a model in which the germline-specific APCCort cooperates with the more general APCFzy, both locally on the meiotic spindle and globally in the egg cytoplasm, to target cyclins for destruction and drive progression through the two meiotic divisions.",APC | Cell cycle | Cks | Cort | Drosophila | Fzy | Meiosis,44,1,,undefined,

In this study, yellow perch were dosed with a polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) mixture and allowed to depurate the chemicals over 1 year under an ambient temperature cycle characteristic of northern temperate latitudes. PCB elimination kinetics during the summer months at optimal water temperature for perch (23°C) were similar to those observed in lab studies with other species reared at their optimal temperature. During the fall and winter seasons, however, elimination of only 11 PCB congeners of log Kow ≤ 5.7 was observed and half-lives averaged >1000 d for these PCBs. PCB elimination was again observed with the onset of spring temperatures but elimination rates averaged 2.6 times slower for readily metabolized congeners and 7.5 times slower for more persistent PCBs than observed during the summer. Bioenergetics modeling efforts predicted maximum values for respiration, fecal egestion, and growth rates during summer months but also predicted rapid declines in these chemical dilution processes during the fall and winter concurrent with changes in temperature. As temperature increased into the spring, bioenergetic rates were predicted to increase but only achieved ∼85% of maximum rates predicted for summer peak temperatures. These results indicate that minimal chemical elimination occurs in perch when metabolic functioning falls to low maintenance levels during the fall and winter. These seasons encompass approximately 8 months of the year at northern temperate latitudes and therefore these patterns have significant consequences for understanding mechanisms of food-web biomagnification of hydrophobic organic chemicals in aquatic systems. © 2007 American Chemical Society.",,47,0,,undefined,

In contrast to these complex calls, the song of black-capped chickadees demonstrates a remarkable simplicity. Although the black-capped chickadee song is simple, interestingly young males inherit songs culturally, and nestlings raised in absence of adult tutors do not develop normal adult song. This chapter explores the ways in which male black-capped chickadees use this simple, learned song to achieve remarkably complex forms of communication. After a brief description of the ways in which male chickadees vary their songs over time, two singing contexts - diurnal countersinging interactions and the dawn chorus - are evaluated. Chickadee singing behaviour is then examined within the new communication network model, and recent research on chickadees which has generated exciting insights into the ecology and evolution of sexual signaling in songbirds is discussed.",Birdsong | Chickadees | Communication networks | Dawn chorus | Diurnal countersinging | Sexual signaling | Singing behaviour,28,0,,undefined,

Aspects of status signaling, such as song and plumage features, as well as rank-related differences in survival and annual reproductive success, are explored. Using extensive observations of interactions among color-banded individuals, the process by which dominance hierarchies are maintained is described. The effects of individual variation in rank acquisition on lifetime reproductive success (LRS) are then addressed.

American kestrels were exposed to contaminants via egg injection and daily gavage dosing over the posthatch-to-fledgling period. Retention factors for PCBs were dependent on chemical hydrophobicity and chlorine substitution patterns and ranged from less than 1 to 16.4% for PCBs having vicinal hydrogen substitutions at meta-, para- carbons on at least one of the phenyl rings and between 13.2 and 81.5% for congeners containing chlorine substitutions at 4,4′-, 3′,4,5′- , 3,4′,5-, or 3,3′,5,5′- positions. These results indicate that juveniles are capable of biotransforming PCBs according to the same structure-activity rules as adults. A toxicokinetic model, initially parameterized using adult toxicokinetic parameters, was used to describe concentration trends in juveniles over time. The adult model overestimated PCB concentrations but provided an adequate fit when elimination rate constants were increased by a factor of 12.7. Retention factors for the PBDE congeners 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 47), 2,2′,4,4′, 6-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 100), 2,2′,4,4′,5-pentabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 99), and 2,2′,4,4′,5,5′-hexabromodiphenyl ether (BDE 153) were from 7.8 to 45.3% of the total dose. The retention of BDE 47 was similar that observed for readily cleared PCBs, whereas the remaining PBDEs exhibited retention factors consistent with those of persistent PCBs. Half-lives for PBDEs in juveniles were estimated to range from 5.6 to 44.7 d. Assuming differences in PBDE toxicokinetics between juveniles and adults similar to those measured for PCBs, adult American kestrel PBDE half-lives are expected to range from 72 to 572 d. © 2007 SETAC.",Bioaccumulation model | Biotransformation | Depuration rates | Organohalogens | Toxicokinetics,53,0,,undefined,

Selection for efficient signal perception should favor the evolution of traits that exhibit an optimal balance between these two design components. We examined the evolution of signal design in the colorful plumage ornaments of manakins (Aves: Pipridae). We used a model of avian color space to quantify how differences in plumage coloration would be perceived by a typical passerine bird and examined patterns of coloration across 50 species of manakin. Using phylogenetically independent contrasts, we show that plumage contrast against the background increases with sexual dichromatism in males but not females, suggesting that sexual selection has favored the evolution of male plumage ornaments that enhance signal efficacy. Plumage contrast within individuals also increased with dichromatism in males but not females. Finally, plumage colors produced by different mechanisms, which may reveal different aspects of quality, resulted in different degrees of contrast against the background. Our findings suggest that selection for signal efficacy and content may sometimes be opposing, creating a trade-off between these two components of signal design. Manakins may mediate this trade-off by combining multiple plumage ornaments that differ in efficacy and content. © 2007 by The University of Chicago.",Avian color space | Manakins | Plumage | Signal content | Signal efficacy | Vision,53,0,,undefined,

INTRODUCTION Globalization, in the context of biological invasions, is the increased movement of species around the world. In this chapter, non-indigenous species (NIS) are defined as taxa moved from one geographic location of the world to another from which they were historically absent. The largest geographic barriers to species dispersal, the world’s oceans, have been circumvented by the development of a global economy. Increased demand for and transport of goods has resulted in the transfer - both intentional and unintentional - of NIS on unprecedented scales. For example, colonization rates of European crustaceans in North America are estimated to be 50 000 times background levels associated with natural dispersal (Hebert and Cristescu 2002). A number of dispersal vectors are responsible for transport of aquatic NIS, though transoceanic shipping has played a particularly important role as the global economy has expanded. Establishment of NIS represents one of the most significant threats to the world’s indigenous biota (Mooney and Drake 1989; Mack et al. 2000), in addition to adverse ecological and economic effects that they impart on lakes throughout the world (e.g., Hall and Mills 2000). For example, establishment of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) in Lake Victoria and peacock bass (Cichla ocellaris) in Gatun Lake resulted in extirpation or decline of native fish species (Zaret and Paine 1973; Ogutu-Ohwaya 1990; Witte et al. 1992).",,2,0,,undefined,

Each year, males progress through a series of predefinitive plumages before attaining definitive plumage in their fifth calendar year. Females also exhibit variation in plumage coloration, with some females displaying male-like plumage characteristics. Using data from mist-net captures in northwest Costa Rica (n = 1,315) and museum specimens from throughout the range of Long-tailed Manakins (n = 585), we documented the plumage sequence progression of males, explored variation in female plumage, and described the timing of molt in this species. Males progressed through a series of age-specific predefinitive plumages, which enabled the accurate aging of predefinitive-plumaged males in the field; this predefinitive plumage sequence is the basis for age-related status-signaling in these males. Females tended to acquire red coloration in the crown as they aged. However, colorful plumage in females may be a byproduct of selection on bright male plumage. Females exhibited an early peak of molt activity from February to April, little molt from May through July, and a second, more pronounced peak of molt activity in October. By contrast, males in older predefinitive-plumage stages and males in definitive plumage exhibited comparable unimodal distributions in molt activity beginning in June and peaking between July and October. Our data are consistent with selective pressure to avoid the costs of molt-breeding overlap in females and older males. Our findings have important implications for social organization and signaling in Long-tailed Manakins, and for the evolution of delayed plumage maturation in birds. © The American Ornithologists' Union, 2007.",Chiroxiphia linearis | Cooperation | Delayed plumage maturation | Hierarchy | Leks | Long-tailed Manakin | Plumage coloration,29,0,,undefined,

In an attempt to better understand mechanisms of acoustic localization, we used the round goby (Neogobius melanostomus), a hearing generalist, to assess responses to calls in the lab and field. The call used for playback was recorded in the field from an actively displaying male round goby and consisted of a series of low frequency pulses. In the field, playback of the call resulted in a significant enhancement of approaches toward, and entries into, an experimental arena as compared to when the sound was off. There was no effect on the amount of time spent near the speaker however. In the lab, males and females responded actively when calls were played and females showed a significant attraction to the playing speaker. Responses were highly directional with little angular deviation, suggesting true localization to the sound source. While the sensory mechanisms allowing round gobies to selectively respond to conspecific vocalizations remain unknown, it is clear that they do show highly directional responses to acoustic cues in both laboratory and field settings. © 2007 Brill Academic Publishers.",,33,0,,GA,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Mandatory ballast water exchange (BWE) was implemented for vessels carrying ballast water into the Great Lakes in 1993. Despite the implementation of this policy, few data are available on its effectiveness, and invasions have continued to be reported in the Great Lakes. In this study, we conducted experiments to assess the efficacy of BWE on six operational transoceanic vessels traveling from the Great Lakes to European ports. Each vessel had paired ballast tanks, one of which was designated as a control that remained filled with Great Lakes water, while the other was exchanged with mid-ocean water. Community composition was assessed immediately after tanks were filled and again prior to water discharge in European ports. BWE was verified by ship records and, in two cases, by in situ water quality sensors. BWE was highly effective (>99% loss) for reducing concentrations of freshwater zooplankton. Live sentinel amphipods and oligochaetes deployed in incubator chambers sustained nearly universal mortality in tanks that experienced BWE, but not in unexchanged tanks. Finally, BWE reduced in situ recruitment of zooplankton from diapausing eggs present in ballast sediments in additional incubator chambers deployed in these tanks. Collectively, these studies support the contention that BWE by transoceanic vessels traveling between freshwater ports results in ballast water that would exceed proposed International Maritime Organization (2004) ballast water performance standards if these standards were applied to freshwater species only. Thus, BWE provides strong protection to freshwater ecosystems against invasions by both pelagic and benthic freshwater species. © 2007, by the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography, Inc.",,60,0,,undefined,

The purpose of this study was to assess responses by government agencies regarding allocation of funding to NIS projects between 2000 through 2005. NIS is considered a major and increasing problem by eight often major funding agencies in the basin. Despite this, total funding decreased from $5.1 to $3.2 million dollars per annum and the number of projects supported declined concomitantly from 145 to 98 during this period. Control or ecosystem effects received the greatest allotment of resources and represented the largest number of projects. Non-taxonomic specific topics, including risk assessment and ballast tank assessment and management, received more funding than any taxon-specific projects and comprised the majority of studies on prevention, spread, and socioeconomic impacts of NIS. Among the latter, fish and Dreissena mussels were the most popularly funded topics, and comprised the largest contribution to ecosystem effects and biology studies. Control studies principally addressed sea lamprey, round gobies and carp species. Prevention studies had the highest funding rate per capita ($ per study). Surprisingly, no clear shifts occurred with respect to the relative importance of projects pertaining to prevention over the period studied despite the recognized importance of this aspect of research.",Great Lakes | Invasive species | Nonindigenous species | Research funding,3,0,NIS,undefined,National Science Foundation

In consequence, sediments and water in these areas are often contaminated by an array of chemicals. Sediments also harbour both living, active stages and various diapausing or resting stages of biota. International shipping activities move sediments containing these biotic stages around the world, possibly resulting in biological contamination of port areas. In this study we assess active and resting stages of invertebrates contained in ballast sediment of transoceanic vessels operating on the North American Great Lakes to determine if ballast sediments could serve as a vector of nonindigenous species. A cumulative total of 160 species were identified, including 22 freshwater species not recorded from the Great Lakes' basin. Hatch rates of resting stages are affected by thermal conditions, thereby affecting invasion success. Total abundance and species diversity of freshwater invertebrate animals hatched from resting stages were negatively related to salinity of residual water in ballast tanks from which the sediments were obtained, suggesting that ballasting a shallow lens of saltwater may provide some degree of risk reduction from freshwater species invasions.

We delineated thousands of Great Lakes watersheds using previously proven and new watershed delineation techniques. These were used to provide summaries for a variety of anthropogenic stressors within the Great Lakes. All delineation techniques proved useful, but each had applications for which they were most appropriate. A set of watershed delineations and stressor summaries was developed for sampling site identification, providing relatively coarse strata for selecting sites along the U.S. Great Lakes coastline. Subsequent watershed delineations were used for high-resolution site characterization of specific sites and characterizing the full coastal stressor gradient. For these delineations we used three general approaches: 1) segmentation of the shoreline at points midway between adjacent streams and delineation of a watershed for each segment; 2) specific watershed delineations for sampled sites; and 3) a Great Lakes basin-wide, high-resolution approach wherein sub-basins can be agglomerated into larger basins for specific portions of the coast. The third approach is unique in that it provides a nested framework based on hierarchies of catchments with associated stressor data. This hierarchical framework was used to derive additional watershed delineations, and their associated stressor summaries, at four different scales. Providing anthropogenic stressor metrics in such a format that can quickly be summarized for the entire basin at multiple scales, or specifically for particular areas, establishes a strong foundation for quantifying and understanding stressor-response relationships in these coastal environments.",Aquatic ecology | Coastal | Great Lakes | Indicators | Scale | Watersheds,29,0,,EPA/R-8286750,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

We sampled zoobenthos in parts of the western and central basins yearly from 1997-2005, along the north shore of the eastern basin in 2001-2002, and throughout the lake in 2004. In the island area of the western basin, Hexagenia was present at densities ≤ 1,278 nymphs/m2 and exhibited higher densities in odd years than even years. By contrast, Hexagenia became more widespread in the central basin from 1997-2000 at densities ≤ 48 nymphs/m2 but was mostly absent from 2001-2005. Nymphs were found along an eastern basin transect at densities ≤ 382/m2 in 2001 and 2002.

Hexagenia was found at 2 of 62 stations (≤ 91 nymphs/m2) in harbors, marinas, and tributaries along the south shore of the central basin in 2005. Oxygen depletion at the sediment-water interface and cool temperatures in the hypolimnion are probably the primary factors preventing successful establishment throughout much of the central basin.

The seminal vesicles of reproductively mature males were examined by conventional histology, transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry (utilizing an antibody against 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase - a key enzyme in vertebrate steroid synthesis). All three procedures identified Leydig cells in the proximal and medial regions of the seminal vesicles. In vitro incubation of seminal vesicles with tritiated androstenedione demonstrated biosynthesis of 11-oxo-androstenedione, 11-oxo-testosterone (more commonly known as 11-ketotestosterone) and 11 oxo-ETIO.

We investigated acquisition of social dominance in winter flocks and its fitness consequences in male black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapillus) over a 10-year period. Age was the best predictor of rank, and paired comparisons showed high-ranked males to be older than their low-ranked flock-mates. When controlling for age, morphological variables did not predict male social rank, but high-ranked males were heavier, had lower fat scores and were in leaner condition than low-ranked males. Males that survived between years tended to increase in rank over time; however, the rate of rank advancement varied individually. Rank reversals between familiar contestants were rare, and changes in male social rank were associated with changes in flock membership. Average lifetime reproductive success (LRS) of males and females was variable and best predicted by lifespan. Male rank history also influenced realized reproductive success. Birds with higher average rank over their lifespan were more likely to reproduce successfully. However, among successful birds, average rank did not significantly predict LRS. Thus, birds that lived longer and attained high social rank earlier had higher fitness, but this effect was not manifested as fine-scale differences among successful individuals. Taken together, these findings demonstrate the importance of social factors influencing individual fitness. © 2007 The Linnean Society of London.",Dominance | Flock fidelity | Individual history,35,1,,undefined,

We evaluated two indices of biotic integrity (IBIs) developed for fish in Great Lakes coastal wetlands dominated (> 50% cover) by Typha (cattail) and Schoenoplectus (formerly Scirpus) (bulrush) vegetation. Thirty-three coastal wetlands dominated by either Typha or Schoenoplectus vegetation were sampled using fyke nets set overnight. These sites were selected to span anthropogenic disturbance gradients based on population density, road density, urban development, point-source pollution, and agricultural inputs (nutrients, sediments), measured using a GIS-based analysis of Great Lakes coastal land use. Sites subject to low levels of anthropogenic influence had high IBI scores. The Typha-specific IBI showed a marginally significant negative correlation with population density and residential development (r = -0.54, p < 0.05; n = 21). The Schoenoplectus-specific IBI negatively correlated most strongly with nutrient and chemical inputs associated with agricultural activity and point-source pollution (r = -0.66 and -0.52, respectively; p < 0.01; n = 30). However, some relationships between IBI and disturbance scores were non-linear and likely exhibit a threshold relationship, particularly for Schoenoplectus dominant sites. Once a certain level of disturbance has been exceeded, a sharp change in fish community's composition and function occurs which is symptomatic of a degraded site. The IBI indices appear to indicate effects of some, but not all classes of anthropogenic disturbance on fish communities. Calibrating these measures against specific stress gradients allows one to interpret the sources of impairment, and thereby use the measures beyond a simple identification of impaired sites.",Anthropogenic stressors | Coastal wetland | Fish IBI | Great Lakes | Schoenoplectus | Typha,13,0,,EPA/R-828777,U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

Re-setting nets for a second night increased species richness by an average (± SE) of 12 ± 0.06%. This translated to an average of 2.5 ± 0.25 additional species captured.

We assessed the responsiveness of 66 candidate indicators to human disturbance (agriculture, urban development, and point source contaminants) characterized at multiple spatial scales (100, 500, 1,000, and 5,000 m buffers and whole watersheds) using classification and regression tree analysis (CART). Non-stressor covariables (lake, ecosection, watershed, and wetland area) accounted for a greater proportion of variance than disturbance variables. Row-crop agriculture and urban development, especially at larger spatial scales, were about equally influential and were more explanatory than a contaminant stress index (CSI). The CSI was an important predictor for diatom indicators only. Stephanodiscoid diatoms and nest-guarding fish were identified as two of the most promising indicators of row-crop agriculture, while Ambloplites rupestris (fish) and Aeshna (dragonflies) were two of the strongest indicators of urban development. Across all groups of taxa and spatial scales, fish indicators were most responsive to the combined influence of row-crop and urban development. Our results suggest it will be critical to account for the influence of potentially important non-stressor covariables before assessing the strength of indicator responses to disturbance.

The neurons were first characterized on the basis of their response to tone bursts presented to the contralateral ear and a distinction was made between those with transient onset responses and those with sustained responses. Sinusoidal AM tones were then presented to the contralateral ear with a carrier that matched the neuron's characteristic frequency (CF). Modulation transfer functions were generated on the basis of firing rate (MTFFR) and vector strength (MTFVS). Ninety-two percent of onset neurons that responded continuously to AM tones had band-pass MTFFRs with best modulation frequencies from 10 to 300 Hz. Fifty-four percent of sustained neurons had band-pass MTFFRs with best modulation frequencies from 10 to 500 Hz; other neurons had band-suppressed, all-pass, low-pass, or high-pass functions. Most neurons showed either band-pass or low-pass MTFVS. Responses were well synchronized to the modulation cycle with maximum vector strengths ranging from 0.37 to 0.98 for sustained neurons and 0.78 to 0.99 for onset neurons. The upper frequency limit for response synchrony was higher than that reported for inferior colliculus, but lower than that seen in more peripheral structures. Results suggest that VNLL neurons, especially those with onset responses to tone bursts, are sensitive to temporal features of sounds and narrowly tuned to different modulation rates. However, there was no evidence of a topographic relation between dorsoventral position along the length of VNLL and best modulation frequency as determined by either firing rate or vector strength.

Reduction of the storage temperature from -20 to -30°C slowed down the degradative processes. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis indicated that fish muscle treated with cryoprotective mixture S8 (40 g L-1 sorbitol/3 g L-1 sodium tripolyphosphate/4 g L-1 sodium alginate) showed minimal post mortem changes in myofibrillar proteins. Ultrastructural results also revealed post mortem damage to the muscle, seen earliest (within 6 months) in the sample frozen-stored without additives (S2), as compared with the normal, unfrozen muscle (S1). The influence of cryoprotectants alone and in combination on fish muscle structural proteins, myosin and actin filaments (A and I bands), during prolonged frozen storage was investigated. After 12 months, samples frozen-stored with various cryoprotective additives (S2-S7), except S8, showed signs of myofibrillar disintegration. Beyond that time the degradative processes started showing up in all samples, with minimal muscle ultrastructural damage in sample S8. Again, reducing the storage temperature from -20 to -30°C slowed down the degradative processes. Ultrastructural results correlated well with levels of biochemical enzymes (Ca2+ myofibrillar ATPase and succinic dehydrogenase) during frozen storage. This is the first report of the cryoprotective effects of these additives on this popular edible fish species. Of the various combinations of additives tested, cryoprotective mixture S8 was found to preserve the muscle structure longest under frozen storage conditions. However, even this mixture was only effective for 18 months at -30°C. Beyond that time the myofibrillar degradative processes were apparent with correlative electrophoretic, biochemical and ultrastructural studies. © 2006 Society of Chemical Industry.",Ca   m-ATPase 2+ | Cryoprotective additives | Cryostabilisation | Muscle ultrastructure | Myosin and actin filaments | Prolonged frozen storage | Z line disintegration,3,0,,undefined,

Invasions by harmful nonnative species are increasing in number and area affected; the damages to ecosystems, economic activity, and human welfare are accumulating. Without improved strategies based on recent scientific advances and increased investments to counter invasions, harm from invasive species is likely to accelerate. Federal leadership, with the cooperation of state and local governments, is required to increase the effectiveness of prevention of invasions, detect and respond quickly to new potentially harmful invasions, control and slow the spread of existing invasions, and provide a national center to ensure that these efforts are coordinated and cost effective. Specifically, the Ecological Society of America recommends that the federal government take the following six actions: (1) Use new information and practices to better manage commercial and other pathways to reduce the transport and release of potentially harmful species; (2) Adopt more quantitative procedures for risk analysis and apply them to every species proposed for importation into the country; (3) Use new cost-effective diagnostic technologies to increase active surveillance and sharing of information about invasive species so that responses to new invasions can be more rapid and effective; (4) Create new legal authority and provide emergency funding to support rapid responses to emerging invasions; (5) Provide funding and incentives for cost-effective programs to slow the spread of existing invasive species in order to protect still uninvaded ecosystems, social and industrial infrastructure, and human welfare; and (6) Establish a National Center for Invasive Species Management (under the existing National Invasive Species Council) to coordinate and lead improvements in federal, state, and international policies on invasive species. Recent scientific and technical advances provide a sound basis for more cost-effective national responses to invasive species. Greater investments in improved technology and management practices would be more than repaid by reduced damages from current and future invasive species.

Polychlorinated biphenyls were grouped according to their structural properties to determine whether congeners with specific structures were eliminated more rapidly than others, which would suggest the occurrence of metabolic biotransformation. For both species and at all life stages studied, PCBs with adjacent unsubstituted meta-para sites (group-2 PCBs) were eliminated significantly faster than PCBs with adjacent unsubstituted ortho-meta sites (group-3 PCBs). Because these groups of PCBs span similar hydrophobicity ranges, it was concluded that green and leopard frogs can selectively metabolize group-2 PCBs. Metabolic activity was more pronounced in the metamorph stage than in any other life stage. In green frog metamorphs, the average elimination rate of the group-2 PCBs was 4.9-fold greater than that of the group-3 PCBs.

With the aid of logistic regression, we estimated the probability of adult mayfly swarms (≥50 individuals/m2), occurring on any given night in western Lake Erie, using meteorological data. We sampled adult Hexagenia Walsh, 1863 from 2130 (sunset) to 2300 on 18 dates in 2000 (2 June - 18 July), with the largest numbers retrieved between 13 June and 2 July. Water temperature (20°C) was the cue to the onset of swarming (subimagos). Highest mean (±SE) density of all Hexagenia adults (subimagos and imagos) was 24 740 ± 8 757 individuals/m2. Overall, 10-fold more imagos (mostly females) than subimagos were attracted to lights. Of the factors examined (air and water temperature, Julian day, dew point, heat index, humidity, moon phase, wind chill, wind direction, wind speed), onshore wind speed (0-9.2 km/h) on calendar dates for which the water temperature exceeded 20°C was the most significant factor to account for total adult swarms. Eighty-three percent of the 18 swarming events observed in 2000 were correctly predicted. Validity of the model was confirmed with data collected in 2002, during which 5 of 6 swarming events were correctly predicted from the logistic model.

Many taxa were recorded that are not native to Chesapeake Bay, supporting the contention that residual ballast represents an invasion vector of some risk to marine systems. Composition and propagule supply differed relative to that in ships entering the Laurentian Great Lakes (e.g. marine taxa dominated in Chesapeake Bay ships), indicating that risk varies geographically. Average abundances of active invertebrates in residual sediment (1002.1 ind. kg-1) and water (2.7 ind. l-1), and diapausing eggs in sediments (779.4 eggs kg -1), were typically low relative to those in ships entering the Great Lakes (1322.5 ind. kg-1, 10.9 ind. l-1 and 3650.0 eggs kg-1, respectively). However, due to high variability among ships, differences were not statistically significant. The major cause of composition and abundance differences is dissimilar trade routes between each system, with vessels entering Chesapeake Bay primarily originating from marine rather than freshwater ports, and because diapausing stages are less commonly found among marine invertebrates. Low propagule supplies, predominant intra-continental ship movements, and salinity disparity between the upper (20 to 28 ‰) and lower (3 to 8‰) regions of Chesapeake Bay (where ballast water is loaded and offloaded) may greatly reduce invasion risk and be a contributing factor to the bay's low invasion rate: invasion risk from non-ballasted ships here may be low relative to hull fouling or ballast water discharge. Other marine coastal areas may be at greater risk from this vector. © Inter-Research 2006.",Ballast sediments | Great Lakes | NOBOB vessels | Nonindigenous species | Resting eggs,14,1,,undefined,

However, these processes are also influenced by multiple invasions, the number of individuals introduced and the degree of similarity between source and receiving habitats. The amphipod Gammarus tigrinus provides a useful model to assess these factors, as its invasion history has involved major environmental transitions. This species is native to the northwest Atlantic Ocean, although it invaded both brackish and freshwater habitats in the British Isles after introduction more than 65 years ago. It has also spread to similar habitats in Western Europe and, most recently, to Eastern Europe, the Baltic Sea, and the Laurentian Great Lakes. To examine sources of invasion and patterns of genetic change, we sampled populations from 13 native estuaries and 19 invaded sites and sequenced 542 bp of the mitochondrial COI gene. Strong native phylogeographical structure allowed us to unambiguously identify three allopatrically evolved clades (2.3-3.1% divergent) in invading populations, indicative of multiple introductions. The most divergent clades occurred in the British Isles and mainland Europe and were sourced from the St Lawrence and Chesapeake/Delaware Bay estuaries. A third clade was found in the Great Lakes and sourced to the Hudson River estuary. Despite extensive sampling, G. tigrinus did not occur in freshwater at putative source sites. Some European populations showed reduced genetic diversity consistent with bottlenecks, although selection effects cannot be excluded. The habitat distribution of clades in Europe was congruent with the known invasion history of secondary spread from the British Isles. Differences in salinity tolerance among lineages were suggested by patterns of habitat colonization by different native COI clades. Populations consisting of admixtures of the two invading clades were found principally at recently invaded fresh and brackish water sites in Eastern Europe, and were characterized by higher genetic diversity than putative source populations. Further studies are required to determine if these represent novel genotypes. Our results confirm that biological invasions need not result in diminished genetic diversity, particularly if multiple source populations, each with distinctive genetic composition, contribute to the founding populations. © 2006 The Authors.",Amphipod | Bottlenecks | Freshwater adaptation | Genetic diversity | Invasion | Phylogeography,86,0,,undefined,

Hypothesis: Barriers can lead to dramatic population divergence even over small geographic distances, especially when such barriers prevent dispersal and ultimately gene flow among closely related populations. Organism: Caridina lanceolata Woltereck, 1937. Field site: Lake Matano (Sulawesi, Indonesia) is the hydrological head of the Malili Lakes and is separated from downstream lakes by the Petea River, which negotiates a 72-m change in elevation, part of which consists of highly flowing rapids. Methods: We use morphological traits and genetic data to assess relationships among populations that occur above and below this barrier. Conclusions: The lack of morphological and phylogenetic differentiation among populations within lakes indicates no barriers to gene flow within lake systems. Elevated phylogentic differences between lakes, however, coupled with subtle morphological discontinuities indicates strong differentiation across the Petea River. Thus, dispersal and gene flow of C. lanceolata is restricted by the Petea River, leading to significant population structure among sampled populations. The magnitude of the cross-river genetic differentiation coupled with overall general morphological similarities among populations is consistent with cryptic sibling species. © 2006 Denis Roy.",Cryptic species | Dispersal | Ecological significant unit | Lake Matano | Malili Lakes | Population divergence | Vicariance,17,0,,undefined,

Biodiversity assessments of lakes depend on the ability to identify the complement of species present, although the degree of sampling required is often uncertain. We utilise long-term data to predict rotifer species richness in three habitats in three Polish lakes using rarefaction sampling methods. 2. Richness in littoral and psammon habitats did not saturate, even with up to 130 samples. Highest richness was observed in psammon habitat (119 species) in Lake Mikolajskie, followed by littoral habitat in Lakes Łuknajno (114 species) and Kuc (110 species). Littoral habitats in Lakes Łuknajno (56%) and Kuc (51%) had the most species not shared with other habitats in the same lake. 3. Species richness (Chao2) estimates ranged between 44 for pelagic and 135 for psammon habitat in Lake Mikolajskie, to 100 for psammon and 137 for littoral habitat in Lake Kuc, and 65 for pelagic and 162 for littoral habitat in Lake Łuknajno. Whole lake estimates were 167, 205 and 171 species, respectively, for these lakes, higher than the 150 to 160 species predicted by Dumont and Segers (Hydrobiologia, 1996, 341, 125). 4. Using standardised sampling, richness was significantly higher in littoral than either pelagic or psammon habitats. Contrasts of standardised rarefaction curves revealed that richness in Lakes Kuc and Mikolajskie was described as well by littoral-only or psammon-only samples, respectively, as by those randomly drawn from across all habitats in the lake. 5. Species richness estimates for Lake Mikolajskie were highest in summer, followed by autumn and spring. Interannual estimates differed by up to 427%, nearly an order of magnitude greater than maximal seasonal variation of 70%. 6. Results indicate that much higher sampling intensity is required to establish species richness than is presently carried out in most lakes. Because many species can be detected only with very intensive sampling, conservation programmes must consider sampling intensity when designing studies. © 2006 The Authors.",Littoral | Planktonic | Rarefaction | Rotifers | Species diversity,31,0,,undefined,

In addition, Steere's Liocichla have a prominent yellow plumage patch on the lores that was significantly larger in males than females for both live birds and museum specimens. We also used reflectance spectrometry to quantify the color of the yellow-green breast feathers of Steere's Liocichla and found no significant differences between males and females in brightness, intensity, saturation, or hue.

We studied the growth of American kestrel ( Falco sparverius ) nestlings exposed in ovo and during development to environmentally relevant PBDE congeners and concentrations. Eggs within each clutch, divided between groups by laying sequence, were injected into the air cell at 19 days of incubation with safflower oil or penta-BDE congeners BDE-47, -99, -100, and -153 dissolved in safflower oil (18.7 μg total [Σ] PBDEs/egg), approximating current levels in Great Lakes herring gulls. The measured proportions of BDE congeners found in the dosing oil were 56.4% of BDE-47; 27.2% of BDE-99; 24.8% of BDE-100; and 0.6% of BDE-153. For 29 days, nestlings were orally gavaged daily with the same ΣPBDE mixture (15.6 ± 0.3 ng/g body weight/day). Relative congener abundances in the dosing mixture compared to the carcasses suggest biotransformation of BDE-47; BDE-183 was also detected. PBDE exposure did not affect hatching or fledging success. PBDE-exposed nestlings were larger (weight, bones, feathers) as they gained weight more quickly and ate more food, the latter in association with their ΣPBDE body burdens. BDE-100 was most influential on nestling growth, being positively associated with size, weight gain, and food consumption. Increasing concentrations of BDE-183 and -153 were related to longer bones, and BDE-99 to longer feathers. The larger size of the PBDE-exposed birds may be detrimental to their bone structure and have excessive energetic costs. The repeated relationships with BDE-100 and growth may be important for wild Falconidae , since this is the predominant penta-BDE congener in these raptors.

These genes are among the most polymorphic in genomes and the mechanism that maintains the diversity has been actively debated with arguments for natural selection centering on either additive or nonadditive genetic effects. Here, we use a quantitative genetics breeding design to examine the genetic effects of MHC class IIB alleles on offspring survivorship in Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha). We develop a novel genetic algorithm that can be used to assign values to specific alleles or genotypes. We use this genetic algorithm to show simultaneous additive and nonadditive effects of specific MHC class IIB alleles and genotypes on offspring survivorship. The additive effect supports the rare-allele hypothesis as a potential mechanism for maintaining genetic diversity at the MHC. However, contrary to the overdominance hypothesis, the nonadditive effect led to underdominance at one heterozygous genotype, which could instead reduce variability at the MHC. Our algorithm is an advancement over traditional animal models that only partition variance in fitness to additive and nonadditive genetic effects, but do not allocate these effects to specific alleles and genotypes. Additionally, we found evidence of nonrandom segregation during meiosis in females that promotes an MHC allele that is associated with higher survivorship. Such nonrandom segregation could further reduce variability at the MHC and may explain why Chinook salmon has one of the lowest levels of MHC diversity of all vertebrates. © 2006 The Authors.",Chinook salmon | Fitness | Genetic quality | Major histocompatibility complex | Overdominance | Rare allele,80,0,,undefined,

However, the sequence of the wheat genome has not been completely characterized due to its complexity and large size. To circumvent this obstacle and identify genes involved in cold acclimation and associated stresses, a large scale EST sequencing approach was undertaken by the Functional Genomics of Abiotic Stress (FGAS) project. Results: We generated 73,521 quality-filtered ESTs from eleven cDNA libraries constructed from wheat plants exposed to various abiotic stresses and at different developmental stages. In addition, 196,041 ESTs for which tracefiles were available from the National Science Foundation wheat EST sequencing program and DuPont were also quality-filtered and used in the analysis. Clustering of the combined ESTs with d2_cluster and TGICL yielded a few large clusters containing several thousand ESTs that were refractory to routine clustering techniques. To resolve this problem, the sequence proximity and ""bridges"" were identified by an e-value distance graph to manually break clusters into smaller groups. Assembly of the resolved ESTs generated a 75,488 unique sequence set (31,580 contigs and 43,908 singletons/singlets). Digital expression analyses indicated that the FGAS dataset is enriched in stress-regulated genes compared to the other public datasets. Over 43% of the unique sequence set was annotated and classified into functional categories according to Gene Ontology. Conclusions: We have annotated 29,556 different sequences, an almost 5-fold increase in annotated sequences compared to the available wheat public databases. Digital expression analysis combined with gene annotation helped in the identification of several pathways associated with abiotic stress. The genomic resources and knowledge developed by this project will contribute to a better understanding of the different mechanisms that govern stress tolerance in wheat and other cereals. © 2006 Houde et al., licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,88,1,,undefined,

Close parallels between gill ventilation and olfactory responses, led us to conduct an empirical study that used two different olfactory sensory deprivation techniques to seek a causal relationship between olfactory epithelial activity and hyperventilation. Chemical lesion of olfactory sensory neurons or mechanical occlusion of the nasal cavities inhibited gill ventilation responses of reproductive male round gobies to estrone (1,3,5(10)-estratrien-3-ol-17-one) and to ovarian extracts.

The promise of protein microarrays is to allow us to study the molecular interactions of protein, lipids, small molecules, and carbohydrates. They can be exploited to analyze a single protein pair interaction, to address changes in multiple protein levels as a response to treatment (i.e., drug or radiation), or in a pathological condition.

In addition, thresholds for detecting an increase in the duration of a noise burst were determined for various standard durations. The difference thresholds were constant for values between 10 and 50 ms but increased progressively, with standard durations between 0.1 and 1.0 s.

Most of the neurons (55%) had V- or U-shaped frequency-tuning curves with a single clearly defined characteristic frequency (CF). However, many neurons had more complex, multipeaked tuning curves (37%), or other patterns (8%). Temporal firing patterns included both onset and sustained responses to contralateral tone bursts. Onset and sustained responses were distributed along the dorsoventral length of VNLL with no indication of segregation into different regions. Onset neurons had shorter average first-spike latencies than neurons with sustained responses (means, 8.3 vs. 14.8 ms). They also had less jitter, as reflected in the SD of first-spike latencies, than neurons with sustained responses (means, 0.59 and 4.2 ms, respectively). The extent of jitter decreased with an increase in stimulus intensity for neurons with sustained responses, but remained unchanged for onset neurons tested over the same range. Many neurons had binaural responses, primarily of the excitatory/inhibitory (EI) type, widely distributed along the dorsoventral extent of VNLL. Local application of the AMPA receptor antagonist NBQX reduced excitatory responses, indicating that responses were dependent on synaptic activity and not recorded from passing fibers. The results show that many neurons in VNLL have a precision of timing that is well suited for processing auditory temporal information. In the rat, these neurons are intermingled among cells with less precise temporal response features and include cells with binaural as well as monaural responses.

Young-of-the-year fish, however, exhibited lower nitrogen isotope enrichment over the diet, indicating that the commonly held trophic enrichment factor of 3.4‰ is more suitable for older, slow-growing individuals. PCB accumulation in both species progressed from being dominated by uptake from water in small (<100 g) fish to dietary uptake in larger individuals as a function of bioenergetic constraints such as food energy conversion and contaminant assimilation efficiencies. Significant increases in PCB accumulation were attributed to decreased specific growth rates such that ≤60% of body mass was gained on an annual basis. This effect was most noted in bluegills where higher PCB biomagnification factors were a consequence of increased foraging costs associated with an invertebrate diet. It is concluded that growth-related changes in species bioenergetics regulate both contaminant accumulation and δ15N dynamics. © 2006 NRC.",,30,0,,undefined,

We conducted an experiment in which green frog tadpoles were orally dosed with a PCB mixture; then placed into clean water to eliminate the chemicals as metamorphosis occurred. On several sampling dates before and during metamorphosis, organisms were sacrificed and analyzed to determine lipid contents and concentrations of individual PCB congeners. The majority of the PCBs studied in this experiment showed increases in chemical activity (fugacity) as a result of the physical changes that occurred during amphibian metamorphosis. A positive relationship was observed between PCB hydrophobicity and the magnitude of the fugacity increase. We determined that the fugacity of a persistent PCB congener will increase during green frog metamorphosis if its log KOW value is greater than 5.85. The fugacity of some of the more highly hydrophobic PCBs increased during metamorphosis by up to a factor of 4. Because of the rapid increases in chemical activity that were observed during metamorphosis, we conclude that toxicity tests involving hydrophobic organic contaminants should be conducted not only on tadpoles or adult frogs, but also on metamorphosing amphibians. © 2006 American Chemical Society.",,16,0,,undefined,

In transitional estuarine environments, habitat discreteness and dispersal barriers could enhance divergence and provide insight to evolutionary mechanisms underlying marine and freshwater biodiversity. We examined this by assessing phylogeographic structure in the widespread amphipod Gammarus tigrinus across 13 estuaries spanning its northwest Atlantic range from Quebec to Florida. Mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I and nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1 phylogenies supported deep genetic structure consistent with Pliocene separation and cryptic northern and southern species. This break occurred across the Virginian-Carolinian coastal biogeographic zone, where an oceanographic discontinuity may restrict gene flow. Ten estuarine populations of the northern species occurred in four distinct clades, supportive of Pleistocene separation. Glaciation effects on genetic structure of estuarine populations are largely unknown, but analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) supported a phylogeographic break among clades in formerly glaciated versus nonglaciated areas across Cape Cod, Massachusetts. This finding was concordant with patterns in other coastal species, though there was no significant relationship between latitude and genetic diversity. This supports Pleistocene vicariance events and divergence of clades in different northern glacial refugia. AMOVA results and private haplotypes in most populations support an allopatric distribution across estuaries. Clade mixture zones are consistent with historical colonization and human-mediated transfer. An isolation-by-distance model of divergence was detected after we excluded a suspected invasive haplotype in the St. Lawrence estuary. The occurrence of cryptic species and divergent population structure support limited dispersal, dispersed habitat distribution, and historical factors as important determinants of estuarine speciation and diversification. © 2006 The Society for the Study of Evolution.

We specifically controlled for the potential effects of protein composition of experimental diets on δ15N turnover to determine whether δ15N turnover after a low to high δ15N diet switch (uptake) and a high to low δ15N diet switch (elimination) will occur at the same rate within each consumer tissue. Our results showed that the turnover of δ15N from metabolism and growth differed between uptake and elimination phases in the liver, blood, cartilage, and muscle of freshwater stingrays. During uptake, liver was found to track dietary δ15N more closely than the other tissues, with the highest metabolic turnover rate of δ15N (0.015 day-1), whereas cartilage had the slowest rate of metabolic δ15N turnover (0.0022 day-1) relative to a constant rate of growth among tissues (0.003 day-1).

Here we explore the relationship between male song and male reproductive performance in a free-living population of house finches, Carpodacus mexicanus, a non-migratory, non-territorial songbird. Based on recordings of 20 males, we analyzed three song features (song length, number of unique syllables per song, and song rate) and compared male song with two measures of within-pair reproductive performance (nest initiation date and clutch size) and one measure of extra-pair reproductive performance (whether males sired extra-pair young). We demonstrate a positive association between male song and within-pair reproductive performance; males that sang long songs initiated their first clutch significantly earlier and males that sang songs at a faster rate had larger clutches. Despite the fact that only one of our recorded males sired extra-pair young in the nest of another male, this male's songs were the most elaborate for two of three song features measured, anecdotally suggesting that male song may play a role in both within-pair and extra-pair partner choice.

Positive relationships were observed between lake surface area, growing degree days, number of species, and hatchery supplementation versus genetic diversity.

YOY diets for both species had similar proportions of benthic and epiphytic prey, with YOY rock bass also having a planktonic dietary component. YOY rock bass consequently had a lighter δ13C signature than similarly aged bluegills, suggesting that these individuals are able to exploit prey from more energetically efficient open water habitats. Rock bass became piscivorous during the first full year of growth, with concomitant depletion of the δ13C signature with increasing age, typical of an isotopically depleted phytoplankton δ13C signal. By 7 yr of age, rock bass diets were dominated by crayfish and cyprinids, with no further significant depletion of the δ13C signature. For bluegills, diets were dominated by small benthic invertebrates, regardless of age. δ13C signatures in YOY and 1-yr-old bluegills remained enriched relative to rock bass of the same age, suggesting that bluegill sunfish remain in nearshore shallower littoral habitats for a greater proportion of their life history because of increased predation pressure.

Most of the metals were homogenously distributed throughout reaches of the river, although sites with elevated concentrations were localized mainly along the middle and lower reaches as a result of a pattern of contamination sources and geographic complexity of the river, especially a spatial/temporal variability in water flow.

These results show that adult anurans have relatively low elimination rates of PCBs but exhibit a small capacity for metabolic biotransformation of PAHs that is comparable to that of invertebrates but lower than that of fish.

The survey employed a stratified random sampling design that divided the river into six geostatistical zones consisting of upper, middle, and lower U.S. and equivalent Canadian river reaches. Organic carbon normalized OCS sediment concentrations demonstrated no significant differences between U.S. or Canadian sediments or upstream/downstream gradients suggesting that OCS is derived primarily from sources upstream of the Detroit River. In contrast, sum PCBs and sum PAHs were significantly elevated at U.S. as compared to Canadian stations and demonstrated significant increasing upstream/downstream gradients in organic carbon normalized sediment contamination. The upper and middle U.S. river reaches contained a number of near-shore stations with high localized PCB and PAH sediment concentrations suggesting multiple inputs along the upper U.S. portion of the river. Consistent with past surveys, wide-spread sediment contamination of PCBs and PAHs continues to be observed in the highly industrialized Trenton Channel and downstream of Grosse Isle. Threshold effect level (TEL) sediment quality guidelines for PAHs and PCBs were exceeded in 92.6 and 77.8%, respectively, of stations in Trenton Channel and downstream of Grosse Isle. This large reservoir of degraded sediments in the lower U.S. river reach has the potential to enter Lake Erie during sediment disturbance events and likely contributes to gentoxic stress and increased bioaccumulation of PCBs in resident benthos, fish, and wildlife.",Areas of Concern | Contaminated sediments | Persistent organic pollutants | Remedial Action Plans,36,0,,undefined,Great Lakes Protection Fund

Male and female breeding partners may use duets to communicate with each other, to communicate with same-sex outsiders, or to communicate with opposite-sex outsiders. To evaluate these categories of duet function, I gave stereo duet playback to territorial pairs of duetting rufous-and-white wrens, Thryothorus rufalbus, in northwestern Costa Rica. I simulated duets of a rival pair of wrens by simultaneously broadcasting male and female duet components through separate loudspeakers. Territorial males and females responded aggressively to duet playback by rapidly approaching the speakers and singing both solo songs and duets. Males sang more songs in response to playback than females, but both sexes responded to approximately half of their partner's songs to create duets. The aggressive responses of territorial pairs were consistent with a territorial defence hypothesis for duet function. Males spent more time near the male speaker and approached the male speaker more closely, suggesting that male duet contributions play a role in intrasexually aggressive extrapair communication. Females approached the male and female speakers with similar intensity, although they tended to respond more strongly to the male speaker. In the few cases where females responded independently of their partner, they responded more strongly on the side of the female speaker. Taken together, responses of rufous-and-white wrens to stereo duet playback suggest that duets play a role in territory defence against conspecific rivals, and, for males, duets may play an additional role in mate guarding and paternity guarding. © 2005 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We explored the potential benefits of mixed-species group resting in the cowtail stingray, Pastinachus sephen, and the reticulate whipray, Himantura uarnak, in Shark Bay, Western Australia. From focal follow data on individual resting choice, we first ascertained that cowtails preferred to rest with heterospecifics, as they chose to settle next to whiprays more often than to pass them (with the opposite trend observed for conspecifics). In addition, we determined from filmed boat transects that cowtails formed larger hetero- than monospecific groups despite the low density of whiprays. Possible benefits accrued by the cowtail were investigated in terms of predator protection. Whiprays responded earlier than cowtails to a mock predator (boat), and were most frequently the first to respond when in a mixed group. Thus, cowtails may benefit from grouping with heterospecifics by receiving earlier warning of a predator's approach. A decoy experiment using model whiprays demonstrated that cowtails were more willing to rest with models with relatively longer tails (controlled for body size). Ray tails, which are equipped with a mechanoreceptor capable of detecting predators, may constitute an important secondary means of predator detection aside from early warning. This contention is supported by the observation that stingrays mainly form resting groups when their visual ability is likely to be impaired by environmental conditions, and that tail length is negatively allometric with body size, suggesting its importance in vulnerable early life stages. If the efficacy of the mechanoreceptor increases with tail length, then cowtails may have further improved their likelihood of detecting predators by grouping with longer-tailed heterospecifics. © 2006 Blackwell Verlag.",,33,0,,undefined,

We compared patterns of variation in male and female songs of eastern whipbirds Psophodes olivaceus by analyzing recordings from 16 populations across the species' geographic range in eastern Australia. We found remarkably different patterns of geographic variation between the sexes. Female eastern whipbird songs are easily categorized into discrete song types. Song types are shared between nearby females, but female songs show pronounced differences at a continental scale. In contrast, male eastern whipbird songs show high consistency throughout the species' geographic range. All recorded males share the ability to transpose the frequency of the introductory whistle and most recorded males share the ability to vary the direction of the slope of the terminal whip crack. For eight of nine measured variables, female songs show significantly higher levels of variation than male songs. We discuss whether sex differences in dispersal, song learning strategies, and song function may explain these sex differences in patterns of song variation. We suggest that eastern whipbirds have experienced a decoupling of male and female song learning strategies and that the songs of each sex have responded to different selective pressures in the context of countersinging interactions. We speculate that consistency in male songs throughout the geographic range of eastern whipbirds may arise through female preference for males that perform large bandwidth whip cracks. © Journal of Avian Biology.",,22,0,,undefined,

These species differ in the anatomical relationship between the swim bladder and the inner ear. In weakfish, the swim bladder has a pair of anterior horns that terminate close to the ear, while there are no extensions of the swim bladder in spot. Thus, the swim bladder in spot terminates at a greater distance from the ear when compared to weakfish. With the use of the auditory brainstem response technique, Cynoscion regalis were found to detect frequencies up to 2000 Hz, while Leiostomus xanthurus detected up to 700 Hz.

To explore this criticism, we conducted a meta-analysis that examined characteristics of invasiveness (i.e. the ability of species to establish in, spread to, or become abundant in novel communities) and invasibility (i.e. the susceptibility of habitats to the establishment or proliferation of invaders). There were few consistencies among invasiveness characteristics (3 of 13): established and abundant invaders generally occupy similar habitats as native species, while abundant species tend to be less affected by enemies; germination success and reproductive output were significantly positively associated with invasiveness when results from both stages (establishment/spread and abundance/impact) were combined. Two of six invasibility characteristics were also significant: communities experiencing more disturbance and with higher resource availability sustained greater establishment and proliferation of invaders. We also found that even though 'propagule pressure' was considered in only ∼29% of studies, it was a significant predictor of both invasiveness and invasibility (55 of 64 total cases). Given that nonindigenous species are likely introduced non-randomly, we contend that 'propagule biases' may confound current paradigms in invasion ecology. Examples of patterns that could be confounded by propagule biases include characteristics of good invaders and susceptible habitats, release from enemies, evolution of 'invasiveness', and invasional meltdown. We conclude that propagule pressure should serve as the basis of a null model for studies of biological invasions when inferring process from patterns of invasion. © Springer 2006.",Establishment | Exotic | Introduction | Invasibility | Invasion | Invasive | Invasiveness | Nonindigenous species | Null model | Propagule pressure,570,0,,undefined,University of Windsor

In birds, iridescent colours are produced by feather barbules when light is scattered from alternating layers of keratin, melanin and air. The structure and organization of these layers, and hence the appearance of bird species with different types of plumage iridescence, varies extensively. One principal distinction between different types of iridescent colours is whether they are produced by a single pair of layers or by multiple pairs of layers. Multi-layer iridescence, such as that displayed by hummingbirds, has been relatively well characterized, but single-layer iridescence has only recently been modeled successfully. Here we use electron microscopy, spectrometry and thin-film optical modeling to investigate the glossy, ultraviolet-blue iridescent plumage colouration of adult male satin bowerbirds Ptilonorhynchus violaceus minor. The flattened barbules of adult males are composed of a superficial keratin layer overlying a melanin layer that is several granules thick. A thin-film model based on the thickness of the keratin layer and its two associated interfaces (air/keratin and keratin/melanin) generates predicted reflectance spectra that closely match measured spectra. In addition, hues predicted from this model are positively correlated with measured hues. As predicted from our thin-film model, measured hues shifted to shorter wavelengths at increasing angles of incidence and reflectance. Moreover, we found that individual variation in barbule nanostructure can predict measured variation in both hue and UV-chroma. Thus, we have characterized the microstructure of satin bowerbird barbules, uncovered the mechanisms responsible for producing ultraviolet iridescence in these barbules, and provided the first evidence of a nanostructural basis for individual variation in iridescent plumage colour.",Barbule | Bird | Feather | Iridescence | Structural colour | Thin-film modeling,87,1,,undefined,

We characterised and projected economic costs associated with nuisance NIS in Canada, through a combination of case-studies and an empirical model derived from 21 identified effects of 16 NIS. Despite a severe dearth of available data, characterised costs associated with ten NIS in Canadian fisheries, agriculture and forestry totalled $187 million Canadian (CDN) per year.

The emerald ash borer (Agrilus planipennis), a wood-boring beetle native to South-East Asia, was first reported in the Great Lakes region during summer 2002. The beetle poses an enormous threat to native ash (Fraxinus) species of North America, as untreated trees in infested areas of Ontario, Michigan and Ohio suffer high mortality. We demonstrate that the borer has spread in North America through a combination of diffusive range extension, associated with local flights, and by long-distance 'jump' dispersal associated with human movement of infested sapling or contaminated firewood. Probability of infestation was inversely related to distance from borer epicentres but positively related to the size of human population centres. At least 9 of 39 populations that were first reported in Michigan during 2004 cannot be accounted for by local diffusion, raising the possibility that other unidentified mechanisms may be contributing to the dispersal of the beetle. In the absence of quarantine, by 2005 all of Michigan's lower peninsula was contained within the boundaries of potential diffusive range expansion. Infested ash saplings also were introduced from Michigan to Maryland during 2003, and subsequently transplanted to five sites in Maryland and Virginia. Quarantine and eradication measures have had mixed results: in the south-central USA, the species appears on the brink of eradication, whereas its distribution has continued to spread during 2005 in the Great Lakes region despite extensive containment and quarantine measures. Quarantine success in the Great Lakes region is encumbered by multiple dispersal vectors, larger borer population sizes and by the more extensive geographical distribution that was achieved prior to implementation of control measures. © 2006 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Dispersal kernel | gravity model | Great Lakes | invasive | non-indigenous species | stratified dispersal,126,0,,undefined,

Degree of anthropogenic disturbance in contributing areas to these ecosystems was assessed using a watershed approach for wetland types or a moving window approach for high-energy shorelines. Anthropogenic stress variables included proportions of agricultural or residential land use, information on population and road density, and distance from the nearest point source. Polygons (wetlands) or pixels (high-energy shoreline) were categorized as 'reference' if the magnitude of the most severe stressor, based on its cumulative frequency distribution within that ecoregion, placed it within the lowest 20th percentile. For shorelines, adjacent 'reference' pixels were agglomerated into polygons and a final ranking of polygons containing at least 2 km of shoreline was used to identify candidate reference areas.

Despite an accumulation of evidence that mothers can sex-specifically modulate investment in offspring in relation to maternal quality, few mechanisms have been proposed as to how this is achieved. We explored a hormonal mechanism for sex-biased maternal investment by measuring and experimentally manipulating baseline levels of the stress hormone corticosterone in laying wild female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) and examining effects on sex ratio and sex-specific offspring phenotype adjustment. Here we show that baseline plasma corticosterone is negatively correlated with energetic body condition in laying starlings, and subsequent experimental elevation of maternal baseline plasma corticosterone increased yolk corticosterone without altering maternal condition or egg quality per se. Hormonal elevation resulted in the following: female-biased hatching sex ratios (caused by elevated male embryonic mortality), lighter male offspring at hatching (which subsequently grew more slowly during postnatal development), and lower cell-mediated immune (phytohemagglutinin) responses in males compared with control-born males; female offspring were unaffected by the manipulation in both years of the study. Elevated maternal corticosterone therefore resulted in a sex-biased adjustment of offspring quality favorable to female offspring via both a sex ratio bias and a modulation of male phenotype at hatching. In birds, deposition of yolk corticosterone may benefit mothers by acting as a bet-hedging strategy in stochastic environments where the correlation between environmental cues at laying (and therefore potentially maternal condition) and conditions during chick-rearing might be low and unpredictable. Together with recent studies in other vertebrate taxa, these results suggest that maternal stress hormones provide a mechanistic link between maternal quality and sex-biased maternal investment in offspring. © 2005 by The University of Chicago.

The a priori site classifications, contaminated or reference, were based on soil residues of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its breakdown products (ΣDDT), dieldrin, and other OC pesticides. In 2001, all nestling tissue samples were pooled by site, and residue levels did not reflect the soil contaminant status.

Development of the immune system is regarded as highly resource dependent, and recent data suggest that nestling passerines experience a possible resource-based trade-off between growth and immunity. Given the hypothesized importance of maximizing growth for the larger sex, the corresponding immune system may also exhibit similar sensitivity to limited resources. To better understand how natural variation in brood size and resources might differentially affect growth and immune function in nestlings of a sexually size-dimorphic species, we examined the relationship between brood size and inter-sexual differences in cell-mediated immunity (CMI) and survival in European starling Sturnus vulgaris nestlings where males are larger in both mass and structural size. We hypothesized that male CMI response should be negatively impacted by increasing sibling competition (brood size), especially during periods of low resource availability. In a year of reduced parental provisioning rates and reduced chick growth rates, male offspring exhibited the predicted negative relationship, whereas female CMI response was unaffected. However, in a year of improved provisioning rates and chick growth, neither sex exhibited a negative relationship between immune response and brood size. Thus, natural variation in brood size can affect sex-specific immunity differently in offspring of a sexually size-dimorphic passerine. However, this relationship appears resource-dependent, suggesting that the hypothesized resource-based trade-off may be compensated for in years of adequate resource abundance. © Journal of Avian Biology.",,48,0,,undefined,

Males who left their territory often, or for longer periods, did not have lower within-pair fertilization success. Some males repeatedly visited a neighboring fertile female, but in only 3 of 19 cases where radiotagged males visited a fertile female did the male actually sire offspring with that female.

Many of the induced anomalies are attributable to midline deficits; however, as assessed by molecular markers, ectopic Pitx3 appears to temporarily enlarge the lens field.

We collected residual sediment, water, and associated organisms from 38 NOBOB ships entering the Great Lakes. We recorded seven established Great Lakes' nonindigenous species, including some discovered since ballast water exchange was implemented. Occurrences of species not yet invaded indicate that this vector provides further opportunity for invasion. Collectively, NOBOB vessels appear to constitute a greater risk than ballasted vessels, as they make up a greater proportion of the traffic entering the lakes (∼90%), and they do not undergo ballast exchange.

To assess invasion risk and control of this pathway, we constructed and parameterized a dynamic hatching model for three representative groups of freshwater organisms that undergo diapause: rotifers, cladocerans, and copepods. Numerical model simulations show that ballast sediment is a plausible invasion pathway for all three groups. The model also illustrates that postuptake ballast treatment to remove or kill potential invaders should be applied as late as possible prior to deballasting to minimize the number of live organisms released.

These topics comprise (1) the gross anatomy of the peripheral olfactory organ, including olfactory sensory neuron subtypes and their functional parameters, (2) the ultrastructure of the olfactory epithelium, and (3) recent findings regarding the development of the nasal cavity and the olfactory epithelium. The teleosts are living ray-finned fish, and include descendants of early-diverging orders (e.g., salmon), specialized descendants (e.g., goldfish and zebrafish), as well as the Acanthopterygii, numerous species with sharp bony rays, including perch, stickleback, bass and tuna. Our survey reveals that the olfactory epithelium lines a multi-lamellar olfactory rosette in many teleosts. In Acanthopterygii, there are also examples of flat, single, double or triple folded olfactory epithelia. Diverse species ventilate the olfactory chamber with a single accessory nasal sac, whereas the presence of two sacs is confined to species within the Acanthopterygii. Recent studies in salmonids and cyprinids have shown that both ciliated olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) and microvillous OSNs respond to amino acid odorants. Bile acids stimulate ciliated OSNs, and nucleotides activate microvillous OSNs. G-protein coupled odorant receptor molecules (OR-, V1R-, and V2R-types) have been identified in several teleost species. Ciliated OSNs express the G-protein subunit Gαolf/s, which activates cyclic AMP during transduction. Localization of G protein subunits Gα0 and G αq/11 to microvillous or crypt OSNs, varies among different species. All teleost species appear to have microvillous and ciliated OSNs. The recently discovered crypt OSN is likewise found broadly. There is surprising diversity during ontogeny. In some species, OSNs and supporting cells derive from placodal cells; in others, supporting cells develop from epithelial (skin) cells. In some, epithelial cells covering the developing olfactory epithelium degenerate, in others, these retract. Likewise, there are different mechanisms for nostril formation. We conclude that there is considerable diversity in gross anatomy and development of the peripheral olfactory organ in teleosts, yet conservation of olfactory sensory neuron morphology. There is not sufficient information to draw conclusions regarding the diversity of teleost olfactory receptors or transduction cascades. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.",,117,0,,undefined,

These prolarvae hatch shortly after neural tube formation, and stay within nests for approximately 18 days, before moving downstream to silty areas where they burrow, feed and pass to the larval stage. To explore the possibility that the olfactory system is functioning during this prolarval stage, morphological and physiological development of olfactory sensory neurons was examined. The nasal cavity contained an olfactory epithelium with ciliated olfactory sensory neurons. Axons formed aggregates in the basal portion of the olfactory epithelium and spanned the narrow distance between the olfactory epithelium and the brain. The presence of asymmetric synapses with agranular vesicles within fibers in the brain, adjacent to the olfactory epithelium suggests that there was synaptic connectivity between olfactory sensory axons and the brain. Neural recordings from the surface of the olfactory epithelium showed responses following the application of L-arginine, taurocholic acid, petromyzonol sulfate (a lamprey migratory pheromone), and water conditioned by conspecifics. These results suggest that lampreys may respond to olfactory sensory input during the prolarval stage. © 2006 Springer Science + Business Media, LLC.",,8,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Overall, interbreeding was reciprocal, although some populations showed directional hybridization. Pronounced cytonuclear disequilibrium in post-F1 hybrids indicated a remarkable mating bias not previously reported, which is most likely because of behavioural reproductive preferences. Selection against hybrids was observed in only two populations, indicative of extrinsic selection. Two populations were 'hybrid swarms', with a complete loss of reproductive isolation.

A benefit of these ditches is contaminant mitigation of agricultural storm runoff. This study determined bifenthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin (two pyrethroid insecticides) partitioning and retention in ditch water, sediment, and plant material as well as estimated necessary ditch length required for effective mitigation. A controlled-release runoff simulation was conducted on a 650-m vegetated drainage ditch in the Mississippi Delta, USA. Bifenthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin were released into the ditch in a water-sediment slurry. Samples of water, sediment, and plants were collected and analyzed for pyrethroid concentrations. Three hours following runoff initiation, inlet bifenthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin water concentrations ranged from 666 and 374 μg/L, respectively, to 7.24 and 5.23 μg/L at 200 m downstream. No chemical residues were detected at the 400-m sampling site. A similar trend was observed throughout the first 7 d of the study where water concentrations were elevated at the front end of the ditch (0-25 m) and greatly reduced by the 400-m sampling site. Regression formulas predicted that bifenthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin concentrations in ditch water were reduced to 0.1% of the initial value within 280 m. Mass balance calculations determined that ditch plants were the major sink and/or sorption site responsible for the rapid aqueous pyrethroid dissipation. By incorporating vegetated drainage ditches into a watershed management program, agriculture can continue to decrease potential non-point source threats to downstream aquatic receiving systems. Overall results of this study illustrate that aquatic macrophytes play an important role in the retention and distribution of pyrethroids in vegetated agricultural drainage ditches. © 2005 SETAC.",Aquatic plants | Bifenthrin | Drainage ditches | Lambda-cyhalothrin | Mitigation,84,0,,undefined,

These ships are designated 'no ballast on board' (NOBOB) and constitute > 90% of inbound traffic. We conducted in situ experiments using emergence traps to assess the viability and the introduction potential of invertebrate diapausing stages present in ships' ballast sediment. All trials commenced while vessels operated on the lower lakes (Erie, Ontario) and were completed 6-11 days later at ports on the upper lakes (Michigan, Lake Superior). Eight trials were conducted on four ships using five different ballast sediments. Hatching was observed on every ship, although not from all sediments on all ships. Overall hatch rates were very low (0.5 individuals per 500 g sediment), typically involving activation of < 0.05% of total eggs present. Five species of rotifers and copepod nauplii were hatched from ballast sediments, although only one or two species typically hatched from any one sediment. Results of this study indicate that hatching of diapausing eggs contained in ballast sediment of NOBOB ships poses a relatively low risk of invasion to the Great Lakes. However, as reproduction may occur in tanks, and non-indigenous species may be involved in numerous introduction events, the risk posed by this vector is small but potentially important. While dormancy is a characteristic enabling enhanced survival during transportation in ballast tanks, it becomes a hindrance for introduction. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Ballast water | Biological invasions | Great Lakes | Introduction | Non-indigenous species | Resting stages,25,0,,undefined,

Study design: Asymptomatic women consented for vaginal swabs to be collected at the time of a clinical pelvic examination. Total genomic DNA was isolated from the vaginal swabs. Degenerate, universal polymerase chain reaction primers were used to amplify an approximately 555 base pair region of the universal chaperonin-60 gene, which is found in all eubacteria and eukaryotes, from the total genomic DNA and libraries of cloned polymerase chain reaction products were constructed. Library clones were sequenced, and the resulting sequences were assigned to taxonomic groups on the basis of similarity to reference sequence data. Presence of Chlamydophila psittaci sequences in the samples was confirmed by species-specific polymerase chain reaction. Results: Sixteen of the 23 women who were enrolled had normal flora by Nugent's score of <4 and had adequate polymerase chain reaction product for assessment. Vaginal flora libraries were dominated by a variety of sequences with similarity to Lactobacillus spp L crispatus, L iners, L gasseri, L jensenii, and L buchneri. Other sequences that were identified included representatives of Gardnerella spp, sequences with similarity to Porphyromonas spp and Megasphaera spp and sequences identical to C psittaci. Conclusion: Culture-independent, chaperonin-60 sequence-based molecular methods can lead to the identification of greater diversity within defined taxa compared with those that are identified by standard culture-based methods and to the identification of novel organisms that were not previously associated with vaginal flora. © 2005 Mosby, Inc.

Cks proteins have also been found to promote S-phase via an interaction with the SCFSkp2 Ubiquitination complex. We have characterized the Drosophila Cks gene, Cks30A and we find that it is required for progression through female meiosis and the mitotic divisions of the early embryo through an interaction with Cdk1. Cks30A mutants are compromised for Cyclin A destruction, resulting in an arrest or delay at the metaphase/anaphase transition, both in female meiosis and in the early syncytial embryo. Cks30A appears to regulate Cyclin A levels through the activity of a female germline-specific anaphase-promoting complex, CDC20-Cortex.

We used six published microsatellite markers to survey populations throughout its native and introduced range to identify relationships among potential source populations and introduced ones. Mussels from 12 sites in Eurasia, including the central Caspian Sea and one in North America (Lake Erie), were sampled. Field surveys in the Volga River basin suggested that the species first colonized the middle reach of the river near Kubyshev Reservoir, and thereafter spread both upstream and downstream. Evidence of considerable gene flow among populations was observed and genetic diversity was consistent with a larger, metapopulation that has not experienced bottlenecks or founder effects. We propose that high gene flow, possibly due to multiple invasions, has facilitated establishment of quagga mussel populations in the Volga River system.

Indeed, profound effects of some parasites and predators on host populations are well documented. However, some support for the ERH comes from studies that find a reduction in the species richness of enemies in the introduced range, relative to the native range, of particular hosts. For example, data on helminth parasites of the European starling in both its native Eurasia and in North America support a reduction of parasites in the latter. However, North American 'founder' starlings were likely not chosen randomly from across Eurasia. This could result in an overestimation of enemy release since enemies affect their hosts on a population level. We control for the effects of subsampling colonists and find, contrary to previous reports, no evidence that introduced populations of starlings experienced a reduction in the species richness of helminth parasites after colonization of North America. These results highlight the importance of choosing appropriate contrast groups in biogeographical analyses of biological invasions to minimize the confounding effects of 'propagule biases'. © Springer 2005.",Enemy release hypothesis | European starling | Helminth | invasive | Nonindigenous species | Parasites,18,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

To examine the genetics of these invasions, we isolated five microsatellite DNA loci with between 5 and 19 alleles per locus. We sampled three populations where B. longimanus has been historically present (Switzerland, Italy, and Finland) as well as an introduced European population (the Netherlands) and three North American populations (Lakes Erie, Superior, Shebandowan). Consistent with a bottleneck during colonization (i.e. founder effect), average heterozygosities of the four European populations ranged from 0.310 to 0.599, and were higher than that of three North American populations (0.151-0.220). Pairwise F ST estimates among North American populations (0.002-0.063) were not significantly different from zero and were much lower than among European populations (0.208-0.474). This is consistent with a scenario of high gene flow among North American populations relative to that of European ones. Contrary to an invasion bottleneck, however, Erie and Superior populations contained similar numbers of rare alleles as European populations. Assignment tests identified several migrant genotypes in all introduced populations (the Netherlands, Erie, Superior, Shebandowan), but rarely in native ones (Switzerland, Italy and Finland). A large number of genotypes from North America were assigned to our Italian population suggesting a second, previously unidentified, invasion source somewhere in the region of northern Italy. Together, our results support an invasion bottleneck for North American populations that has been largely offset by gene flow from multiple native sources, as well as gene flow among introduced populations. © 2005 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",Bythotrephes longimanus | Genetic diversity | Invasion genetics | Invasive | Microsatellite DNA | Nonindigenous species,63,0,,undefined,

Adult parasitoids were collected, identified and dissected to determine the presence of Eliminade™ within their guts. Individuals from eight parasitoid species were collected on pine boles within D. frontalis infestations in the Talladega National Forest (Alabama) in the summer of 1999 and 2000. Mean percentage of parasitoids feeding on Eliminade™ was 62 ± 10% during both summers. Percentage of parasitoids feeding was the same 24 h after Eliminade™ application, regardless of food location or parasitoid species. Seven days later, level of parasitoid feeding on Eliminade™ was insignificant in the pine canopy and hardwood understory. In contrast, percent of parasitoid feeding on Eliminade™ applied to pine boles remained the same between 1 and 7 days of the application. Therefore, not only will adult parasitoids visit and feed on artificial food on pine boles with hosts, but also non-host locations such as pine canopy and understory hardwood foliage.

In an analysis of 1010 species of birds, we examined several ecological and behavioural factors in relation to testes size; an index of sperm competition and the extent of extrapair mating. In univariate and multivariate analyses, testes size was significantly larger in species that breed colonially than in species that breed solitarily, suggesting that higher breeding density is associated with greater sperm competition. After controlling for phylogenetic effects and other ecological variables, testes size was also larger in taxa that did not participate in feeding their offspring. In analyses of both the raw species data and phylogenetically independent contrasts, monogamous taxa had smaller testes than taxa with multiple social mates, and testes size tended to increase with clutch size, which suggests that sperm depletion may play a role in the evolution of testes size.

We investigate resting stages of invertebrates in residual ballast sediments of transoceanic ships as a possible vector of NIS to the Great Lakes. To model the introduction effort potentially associated with this vector, we collected sediment samples from 39 ships entering the Great Lakes and measured the density, viability, and species richness of resting stages contained therein.

Apparent ballast-mediated invasions have been recorded in recent years, despite the implementation of voluntary ballast water exchange regulations in 1989. Since unregulated 'no-ballast-on-board' vessels currently dominate inbound traffic to the Great Lakes, it has been proposed that live or dormant organisms contained in residual ballast of these vessels may be partially responsible for recent invasions. Alternatively, euryhaline species may pose a significant invasion threat because they can potentially survive ballast exchange. In this study, we explored whether exposure to open-ocean water (32‰) reduced the viability of invertebrate diapausing eggs in ballast sediments. Sediments collected from three transoceanic ships and from three freshwater habitats were exposed to open-ocean seawater. Egg viability, assessed as the abundance of taxa hatched between exposed and unexposed sediments, was not affected by saltwater exposure in any experiment. Species richness of hatched diapausing eggs was reduced by saltwater exposure in only one of seven trials. Our results indicate that oligostenohaline zooplankton may pose an invasion risk because their diapausing eggs are largely resistant to exposure to open-ocean saltwater. © Springer 2005.",Ballast sediments | Ballast water exchange | Horaella | NOBOB | Nonindigenous species | Resting eggs | Rotifera | Salinity tolerance,29,0,,undefined,Great Lakes Protection Fund

The adult cowtail stingray (Pastinachus sephen) of Shark Bay, Western Australia, is a solitarily foraging animal that facultatively groups when resting on shallow, inshore sand flats. We hypothesized that environmental conditions influence the propensity of cowtails to group due to the limited ability to detect predators visually in certain conditions. We then explored the possible benefits of grouping, such as bodily protection, early warning, and predator confusion, in conjunction with potential grouping costs, such as increased interference when initiating flight and decreased escape speeds. Our study revealed that in poor underwater visibility (due to turbidity and/or low ambient light levels), cowtails primarily rest in small groups (three rays). Tests of flight initiation distance to a mock predator demonstrated that solitary cowtail escape distances are significantly shorter in poor than in good underwater visibility conditions. As to grouping benefits, filmed boat transects revealed that cowtails most often arrange themselves in a rosette position, possibly as a means to protect their bodies and expose their tails. The first cowtail in a group initiates flight to a mock predator at a significantly greater distance than a solitary cowtail, and grouped cowtails escape an approaching boat in a significantly more cohesive manner than a simulated group of escaping individual rays. Grouped cowtails exhibit behaviors that would impede immediate flight after detection. As a result, grouped rays escape a boat at significantly slower speeds than solitary cowtails. Results from this study demonstrate that the interplay between costs and benefits of grouped and solitary resting under differing environmental conditions is driven by differences in perceived predation risk and ultimately reflected in the facultative grouping behavior of this species. © International Society for Behavioral Ecology 2004; all rights reserved.",Antipredator behavior | Facultative grouping | Group resting | Pastinachus sephen | Perceived predation risk | Stingrays,37,1,,PGS-A,PADI Foundation

A model relating tissue turnover rates and endogenous energy conversion efficiencies revealed that chemical elimination in larger organisms is primarily regulated by food limitation and bioenergetic mechanisms rather than chemical kinetics. Lake trout approximately 2500 g and larger were observed to have higher PCB elimination rates than smaller fish as a result of increased lipid mobilization to supplement metabolic demands due to increased time spent foraging. This study concludes that the growth and production of large predators in Lake Ontario are regulated by the bioenergetic constraints of searching for prey in a food-limited environment.

The ability to predict spatially explicit dispersal by non-indigenous species is a difficult but increasingly important undertaking as it allows management efforts to be focused around areas identified as susceptible to invasion. Lakes may serve as useful models for these studies because the habitats are well defined, and vectors of spread may be readily identified and quantified. In this study, we examined patterns of spread of the non-indigenous spiny waterflea Bythotrephes longimanus to inland lakes in Ontario, Canada, to identify lakes for which management efforts to reduce traffic would be most effective. 2. We surveyed people using lakes for recreational purposes to quantify movements of trailered boats and other risky activities, to model relative vector traffic from invaded lakes to non-invaded and other invaded lakes. Non-linear functions were developed to describe the cumulative number of invaded and non-invaded destination lakes visited by people leaving five important lakes already invaded by the spiny waterflea (Huron, Simcoe, Muskoka, Panache and Kashagawigamog). The relative difference in these functions was used to identify which lakes will develop into future invasion hubs and will therefore be most important to future dispersal of the species. 3. In the recent past, Lake Muskoka has been an important hub from which the spiny waterflea has invaded other lakes. It is unlikely to continue to be a source for waterflea invasion as most outbound traffic is to previously invaded lakes. Conversely, most outbound traffic from Lakes Kashagawigamog and Simcoe is to non-invaded lakes and, therefore, these lakes are likely to develop into hubs in the future. 4. Synthesis and applications. These data on zooplankton in lake systems and associated mechanisms of transport indicate patterns not only of intrinsic value to lake management, but also of potential importance in understanding invasions more generally. Frequency distributions of the number of outbound connections to both invaded and non-invaded destinations from invaded sources follow a power function, consistent with scale-free networks. These networks indicate that small proportions of sources function as hubs. Management efforts targeted to remove developing hubs from the invasion network, rather than equal effort applied to outbound vector traffic from all sources, may reduce the predicted rate of new invasions. © 2005 British Ecological Society.",Biological invasions | Bythotrephes | Human vectors | Invading species | Scale-free networks,71,0,,undefined,

We investigated the effect of experimental inoculation with coccidian parasites on the expression of iridescent structural coloration in yearling male turkeys. Prior to moult of ornamental feathers, we assigned turkeys to three experimental groups: we maintained six turkeys free of coccidial infection, inoculated four turkeys with a single species of coccidial oocysts, and inoculated six turkeys with multiple species of coccidial oocysts. We used reflectance spectrometry to quantify the plumage coloration of wing covert and breast feathers in the breeding plumage of males in each treatment protocol. We found significant treatment-based variation in the iridescent plumage coloration of yearling male turkeys such that infected males showed proportionately less UV reflectance in their wing covert and breast feathers and had duller breast feathers. This is the first experimental evidence that parasites can suppress the expression of structural plumage coloration, and our findings suggest that, in wild turkeys, iridescent coloration could serve as a condition-dependent signal of male health. © 2004 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

We measured plumage reflectance for five body regions of 40 male chickadees in late winter and monitored these males throughout the following breeding season to determine whether they survived to breed, whether they successfully paired, whether their partner laid eggs, and both their apparent and realized reproductive success. As expected from past studies, a male's dominance rank significantly predicted whether his partner laid eggs. However, only achromatic plumage reflectance significantly predicted other measures of male reproductive performance. Among males who fledged at least one offspring, both the brightness of white plumage regions and the UV-chroma of melanin-based plumage regions were significant predictors of the proportion of within-pair young in their nests. When we consider all males we measured, assigning zero values to males who failed to sire any offspring, the UV-chroma of melanin-based plumage regions was a significant predictor of realized reproductive success.

This question has puzzled and marveled evolutionary and behavioral ecologists for decades. In mating systems in which males provide direct benefits to the female or her offspring, such as food or shelter, the answer seems straightforward - females should prefer to mate with males that are able to provide more resources. The answer is less clear in other mating systems in which males provide no resources (other than sperm) to females. Theoretical models that account for the evolution of mate choice in such nonresource-based mating systems require that females obtain a genetic benefit through increased offspring fitness from their choice. Empirical studies of nonresource-based mating systems that are characterized by strong female choice for males with elaborate sexual traits (like the large tail of peacocks) suggest that additive genetic benefits can explain only a small percentage of the variation in fitness. Other research on genetic benefits has examined nonadditive effects as another source of genetic variation in fitness and a potential benefit to female mate choice. In this paper, we review the sexual selection literature on genetic quality to address five objectives. First, we attempt to provide an integrated framework for discussing genetic quality. We propose that the term 'good gene' be used exclusively to refer to additive genetic variation in fitness, 'compatible gene' be used to refer to nonadditive genetic variation in fitness, and 'genetic quality' be defined as the sum of the two effects. Second, we review empirical approaches used to calculate the effect size of genetic quality and discuss these approaches in the context of measuring benefits from good genes, compatible genes and both types of genes. Third, we discuss biological mechanisms for acquiring and promoting offspring genetic quality and categorize these into three stages during breeding: (i) precopulatory (mate choice); (ii) postcopulatory, prefertilization (sperm utilization); and (iii) postcopulatory, postfertilization (differential investment). Fourth, we present a verbal model of the effect of good genes sexual selection and compatible genes sexual selection on population genetic variation in fitness, and discuss the potential trade-offs that might exist between mate choice for good genes and mate choice for compatible genes. Fifth, we discuss some future directions for research on genetic quality and sexual selection.",Direct benefit | Fisherian | Genetic benefits | Genetic compatibility | Indirect benefit | Mate choice | Multiple mating,444,0,,undefined,

Although studies of duetting present unique opportunities for understanding conflict and cooperation between the sexes, very few investigations describe the similarities and differences between male and female singing behaviors. Here, we present the first detailed account of the singing behavior of Rufous-and-white Wrens (Thryothorus rufalbus), a resident tropical duetting songbird. Male and female songs share a similar structure, yet show pronounced sex differences. Male songs have lower frequency characteristics and more repeated trill syllables, and often sound louder than female songs. Males sing more than females, and only males show elevated song output at dawn. Both males and females have song repertoires. Males have an average repertoire size of 10.8 song types, whereas females have a significantly smaller average repertoire size of 8.5 song types. Although males share proportionately more of their song types with neighbors than females do, both sexes share more song types with nearby individuals than with distant individuals. Breeding partners combine their solo songs to create duets. Duets assume a variety of different forms, ranging from simple, overlapping male and female songs to complex combinations of multiple male and female songs. Most duets (73%) are created by females responding to male song. Males respond to female-initiated duets with shorter latencies than when females respond to male-initiated duets. Each pair sings certain combinations of song types in duets more often than can be explained by random association, which demonstrates that Rufous-and-white Wrens have duet types. The most common duet type was different for each pair.

Synaptic receptors that mediated the EPSPs and IPSPs were identified using AMPA, NMDA, GABAA and glycine receptor antagonists. The early/short EPSPs were mediated by AMPA receptors. The late/long EPSPs, encountered only in neurons of younger animals, were mediated by NMDA receptors. The IPSPs in most neurons were mediated by glycine receptors. In some neurons the IPSPs were mediated by GABAA receptors or both glycine and GABAA receptors. The temporal dynamics of fast AMPA EPSPs and glycinergic IPSPs were very similar. AMPA EPSPs and glycinergic (and/or GABAergic) IPSPs could be encountered in a single neuron.

Larvae were inoculated into 2-L jars containing Lake Erie sediment and water. Bioturbation and sediment settling rates were independently estimated from sediment concentrations in water, measured twice daily for 14-18 d. Nonlinear regression was used to estimate sediment suspension rate for each jar (flux, mg/L/h). Logarithmic transformations of size, density, and temperature best described sediment flux. Separate experiments demonstrated that flux was unaffected by sediment depth, but did vary by sediment type, which was related to location from which Lake Erie sediment had been collected. Sediment suspension rates increased as food became depleted. Sediment suspension by pre-emergent (25 mm long) larvae at densities and water temperature typical for late spring in western Lake Erie (400 larvae/m2 at 22°C) averaged 12 g/m2/h. Although this level of bioturbation by Hexagenia larvae in western Lake Erie likely contributes only a small fraction of the basinwide annual sediment load, sediment suspension is possibly an important epibenthic source of nutrients and sediment-associated contaminants during spring.

The greater variability in mussel density among stations and replicate samples in the central and west basins than in the east basin is attributable to the preponderance of fine-grained substrata in the nearshore, higher episodic rates of sediment deposition, and periodic hypoxia in bottom waters. Although there was little change in lake-wide mean dreissenid densities between 1992 and 2002 (declining from ca. 2,636 individuals/m2 to 2,025 individuals/m 2), basin-averaged shell-free dry tissue mass increased by almost four-fold from ca. 6.8 ± 15.6 g/m2 to 24.7 ± 71.3 g/m2 in the same interval. Up to 90% of this biomass is in the eastern basin. Other changes in 2002 include the virtual absence of mussels in the 3 to 12 mm size range, probably because of predation by round gobies, and an increase in the average size of mature mussels.

Theory and practice indicate that invasion risk can be diminished by reducing propagule pressure, or the quantity, quality, and frequency of introduced individuals. For aquatic invasions, the primary global invasion pathway is ballast-water transport, and the primary risk reduction strategy is currently open-ocean exchange. Exchange was developed with shipping between freshwater ports in mind, but the majority of shipping connects brackish and marine ports. A worldwide convention, adopted in 2004 by the International Maritime Organization, now mandates ballast-water exchange (or equivalent management) for its 164 member states. Will exchange be as effective in reducing invasion risk for euryhaline species (those capable of tolerating a wide range of salinity levels) in saltwater ports? Here we develop a simple mathematical framework for optimizing ballast-water exchange in terms of exchange level, timing, and species salinity tolerance. Our model shows that when species survival is worse in the post-exchange than in the pre-exchange water, exchange is always effective.

Conversely, abundance of Gammarus is inversely associated with that of an introduced amphipod species, Echinogammarus ischnus. In this study, we explored carbon and nitrogen isotopic composition of E. ischnus, G. fasciatus, and Hyalella azteca and of Dreissena faeces/pseudofaeces from western Lake Erie to investigate possible exploitative competition among amphipods. Carbon isotopic composition (δ 13C) of H. azteca and G. fasciatus were similar, indicating that they share food resources, whereas E. ischnus was significantly depleted indicating its use of different resources. Dreissena faeces/pseudofaeces may be a part of G. fasciatus diet as revealed by carbon isotopic signatures, explaining, in part, why its abundance is positively associated with Dreissena. Phytoplankton may be the primary food source for juvenile E. ischnus and G. fasciatus as they had lighter carbon isotopic signatures than adult amphipods, suggesting an ontogenetic diet shift by both species. Isotopic separation of G. fasciatus and E. ischnus suggests that the latter is replacing the former by a mechanism other than exploitative competition for food.",Amphipod | Food partitioning | Lake Erie | Nonindigenous species | Stable isotopes,34,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

The electrophysiological methods of auditory brainstem response (ABR) and electroolfactogram (EOG) were used to investigate auditory and olfactory abilities of pre- and post-settlement stages of a damselfish, Pomacentrus nagasakiensis (Pisces, Pomacentridae). Audiograms of the two ontogenetic stages were similar. Pre-settlement larvae heard as well as their post-settlement counterparts at all but two of the tested frequencies between 100 Hz and 2,000 Hz.

Similarly, no difference in olfactory ability was found between the two ontogenetic stages. Both stages showed olfactory responses to conspecifics as well as L-alanine. Therefore, the auditory and olfactory senses have similar capabilities in both ontogenetic stages.

Data collected were statistically corrected (""deseasonalized"") to remove biases resulting from irregular sampling intervals within years. Depth-integrated summer temperature has increased by an average (±SE) of 0.037 ± 0.01 °C per year. An observed reduction of Secchi depth (SD) by 7 ± 3 cm/y seems to be unrelated to variation in either total phosphorus (TP) or chlorophyll a concentrations. Midsummer midbasin SD values varied widely between 4 and 10 m, possibly depending on whether phytoplankton were concentrated in the epilimnion (giving shallow SD), or whether phytoplankton had settled out of the epilimnion into the lower layers, giving deeper SD values. Hypolimnetic volume-corrected oxygen depletion (HVOD) rates have also been highly variable, ranging from 2.68 to 4.72 mg/L/mo. These rates are sensitive to production of oxygen in the thermocline and hypolimnion by photosynthetically active phytoplankton that have settled from the epilimnion. The HVOD rate in any year was correlated with the previous year's TP loading into Lake Erie. Since TP loading trends largely reflect the consequences of improving water treatment through the 1980s and increasing contributions from tributary run-off sediments through the 1990s, there is little direct evidence to suggest that the appearance of dreissenids has directly influenced hypolimnial oxygen depletion rates in the central basin. The observation that central-basin HVOD tracked the reductions in TP loadings through the 1980s may be the first affirmation that central basin hypolimnetic oxygen dynamics can be regulated by phosphorus inputs. This implies that TP loads must continue to be regulated if we wish to minimize oxygen depletion rates as a strategy to reduce the frequency of episodic central basin anoxia.",Chlorophyll a | Dreissenidae | Lake Erie | Oxygen deficit | Phosphorus | Turbidity,93,0,,undefined,

Our study is the first to quantitatively assess the relationship between the distribution of nesting cormorants and forest health. On East Sister Island, 2 measures of forest cover were obtained using infrared aerial photographs and ground-based measurements of leaf area index. These measures of forest cover were correlated (rs = 0.70, P < 0.001), which validated the use of remotely sensed data to assess forest cover. Cormorant nest density was negatively correlated with tree cover on both East Sister and Middle Islands. Temporal comparisons of Middle Island data indicated a reduction in tree cover from 1995 to 2001, and these reductions coincided with a large increase in the island's cormorant population.

Furthermore, studies suggest that the pheromone may be a steroid (more specifically a 5β-reduced androgen) produced by specialized glandular tissue in the testes. In the present study, it is shown that the testis of the male round goby contains such specialized glandular tissue. In vitro, the testes convert [3H]androstenedione into 3α-hydroxy-5β- androstane-11,17-dione (i.e., 11-oxo-etiocholanolone, 11-oxo-ETIO); 11-oxo-ETIO sulfate (11-oxo-ETIO-s); 11-oxo-testosterone (i.e., 11-ketotestosterone), 3α-hydroxy-5β-androstan-17-one (etiocholanolone, ETIO); 11β-hydroxy-androstenedione; ETIO sulfate and testosterone. Glucuronidated steroids were not identified. Neither 11-oxo-ETIO nor 11-oxo-ETIO-s has previously been identified in teleost gonads. Both these steroids are formed in the round goby testis even when [3H]17-hydroxyprogesterone is used as a precursor. The fact that, for both steroids, the carbon A ring has a 5β-configuration (already linked with olfactory sensitivity and behavior induction in two other species of gobies) makes them likely candidate pheromones in the round goby.

We demonstrate common ancestry and rapid divergence in one genus (Telmatherina) based on 560 bp of 16S sequence data. We found higher levels of variation in feeding-related traits (N = 8) for Telmatherina relative to the other genera, while no differences were found for sexual display traits (N = 8) or neutral morphological traits (N = 8). Telmatherina also had the highest number of distinct colouration patterns among the four genera. These data, combined with the very low productivity of the lake, are indicative of selection driving adaptive radiation. The morphometric divergence in the Telmatherina likely results from selection acting on feeding traits in this low productivity lake, leading to trophic specialization among closely related morphotypes. These results provide indirect but compelling data supporting the adaptive radiation of Telmatherina in this system.",Ancient lakes | Random drift | Resource partitioning | Sexual selection | Telmatherina | Trophic divergence,23,0,,undefined,

Alternatively, birds may orient their nest entrance relative to conspecific individuals around them, especially if the acoustic properties of cavities permit nesting birds to better hear individuals in front of their nest. We measured the cavity entrance orientation of 132 nests and 234 excavations in a colour-banded population of black-capped chickadees Poecile atricapillus for which the reproductive behaviour of nesting females was known. Most chickadees excavated cavities in rotten birch Betula papyrifera, aspen Populus tremuloides and maple Acer saccharum. Nest cavities snowed random compass orientation around 360° demonstrating that chickadees do not orient their cavities relative to the sun or prevailing winds. We also presented chickadees with nest boxes arranged in groups of four, oriented at 90° intervals around the same tree. Nests constructed in these nest box quartets also showed random compass orientation. To test the acoustic properties of nest cavities, we conducted a sound transmission experiment using a microphone mounted inside a chickadee nest. Re-recorded songs demonstrate that chickadee nest cavities have directional acoustic properties; songs recorded with the cavity entrance oriented towards the loudspeaker were louder than songs recorded with the cavity entrance oriented away from the loudspeaker. Thus, female chickadees, who roost inside their nest cavity in the early morning during their fertile period, should be better able to hear males singing the dawn chorus in front of their nest cavity. Using GIS analyses we tested for angular-angular correlation between actual nest cavity orientation and the azimuth from the nest tree to the territories and nest cavities of nearby males. In general, nest cavity entrances showed no angular-angular correlation with neighbourhood territory features.

Although the location for ultrasound detection has not been proven conclusively, there is a growing body of physiological, developmental, and anatomical evidence suggesting that one end organ of the inner ear, the utricle, is likely to be the detector. The utricle is a region of the inner ear that is very similar in all vertebrates studied to date, except for clupeid fish, where it is highly specialized. Behavioural studies of the responses of American shad to ultrasound demonstrate that they show a graded series of responses depending on the sound level and, to a lesser degree, on the frequency of the stimulus. Low-intensity stimuli elicit a non-directional movement of the fish, whereas somewhat higher sound levels elicit a directional movement away from the sound source. Still higher level sounds produce a ""wild"" chaotic movement of the fish. These responses do not occur until shad have developed the adult utricle that has a three-part sensory epithelium. We speculate that the response of the American shad (and, presumably, other clupeids that can detect ultrasound) to ultrasound evolved to help these species detect and avoid a major predator - echolocating cetaceans. As dolphins echolocate, the fish are able to hear the sound at over 100 m. If the dolphins detect the fish and come closer, the nature of the behavioural response of the fish changes in order to exploit different avoidance strategies and lower the chance of being eaten by the predators. © 2004 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.

In Arabidopsis a novel F-box protein, ZEITLUPE (ZTL), plays an important role in the control of the free-running period of the circadian clock. As a class, F-box proteins are well-established components of the Skp/Cullin/F-box (SCF) class of E3 ubiquitin ligases that link the target substrates to the core ubiquitinating activity of the ligase complex via direct association with the Skp protein. Here we identify and characterize the SCF ZTL complex in detail. Yeast two-hybrid tests demonstrate the sufficiency and necessity of the F-box domain for Arabidopsis Skp-like protein (ASK) interactions and the dispensability of the unique N-terminal LOV domain in this association. Co-immunoprecipitation of full-length (FL) ZTL with the three known core components of SCF complexes (ASK1, AtCUL1 and AtRBX1) demonstrates that ZTL can assemble into an SCF complex in vivo. F-box-containing truncated versions of ZTL (LOV-F and F-kelch) can complex with SCF components in vivo, whereas stably expressed LOV or kelch domains alone cannot. Stable expression of F-box-mutated FL ZTL eliminates the shortened period caused by mild ZTL overexpression and also abolishes ASK1 interaction in vivo. Reduced levels of the core SCF component AtRBX1 phenocopy the long period phenotype of ztl loss-of-function mutations, demonstrating the functional significance of the SCFZTL complex.

In the present study, we describe the extrapair mating system of black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus, and test whether nest locations are influenced by conspecific attraction to extrapair partners. We conducted a spatial analysis of female mating strategies by using microsatellite paternity analysis in conjunction with geographic information system (GIS) analysis of nest and territory locations. Extrapair offspring comprised 52 of 351 offspring (14.8%) and were present in 19 of 57 broods (33.3%). Females paired to males with low dominance status in the previous winter's flock hierarchy were more likely to engage in a mixed reproductive strategy than were females paired to males with high dominance status. Females had extrapair copulations and extrapair fertilizations with high-ranking males more often than with low-ranking males. Not all extrapair copulations resulted in extrapair fertilizations. Females constructed their nests within 16.8 ± 1.0 m of the edge of their partner's territory, significantly closer to the edge of their nearest neighbor's territory than to the center of their own partner's territory. Extrapair males usually shared territory boundaries with cuckolded males. Females paired to low-ranking males constructed nests near the territory edges of neighboring high-ranking males. However, females did not have extrapair copulations with the neighbor nearest to their nest or even with the high-ranking neighbor nearest to their nest.

In white-winged fairy-wrens, Malurus leucopterus, mainland males develop a striking blue nuptial plumage whereas those on nearby islands develop black nuptial plumage. We explore the proximate basis for this divergence by combining microstructural feather analysis with an investigation of genetic variation at the melanocortin-1 receptor locus (MC1R). Fourier analysis revealed that the medullary keratin matrix (spongy layer) of the feather barbs of blue males was ordered at the appropriate nanoscale to produce the observed blue colour by coherent light scattering. Surprisingly, the feather barbs of black males also contained a spongy layer that could produce a similar blue colour. However, black males had more melanin in their barbs than blue males, and this melanin may effectively mask any structural colour produced by the spongy layer. Moreover, the presence of this spongy layer suggests that black island males evolved from a blue-plumaged ancestor. We also document concordant patterns of variation at the MC1R locus, as five amino acid substitutions were perfectly associated with the divergent blue and black plumage phenotypes. Thus, with the possible involvement of a melanocortin receptor locus, increased melanin density may mask the blue-producing microstructure in black island males, resulting in the divergence of plumage coloration between mainland and island white-winged fairy-wrens. Such mechanisms may also be responsible for plumage colour diversity across broader geographical and evolutionary scales.",Fairy-wrens | Feathers | Fourier analysis | Island | Melanin | Structural colour,73,0,,undefined,

In addition, we argue that the ERH has often been accepted uncritically wherever (i) NIS often appear larger, more fecund, or somehow 'better' than either congeners in the introduced region, or conspecifics in the native range; and (ii) known enemies are conspicuously absent from the introduced range.

Chinook salmon from two sources were used as parental stock fish from a commercial salmon farm and fish from a natural population (with an active enhancement program). The study population consisted of farmed and wild purebred families and their reciprocal hybrids. Twelve traits were measured in five areas of performance (survival, saltwater growth, saltwater tolerance, stress response and recovery, and fecundity). Significant cross type effects were found for 5 of the 12 traits, and, generally, the wild purebreds performed best. Notable heterosis (i.e., >1% of the mid-parent values) was demonstrated for nine of the performance traits, with four of those being favourable heterosis. However, none of the heterosis exceeded the performance of the best parental lineage. Individual reciprocal crosses showed greater heterosis, but again generally not useful for breeding programs. The lack of favourable heterosis coupled with its generally small effect when present indicates that crossbreeding for hybrid vigour is of limited utility in Chinook salmon culture. The introduction of novel (wild) genetic material into the farmed population did, however, result in considerable performance improvement in growth-related traits, although a loss in disease survival performance was also realized. The observed differences in performance between the purebred wild and farmed families is likely primarily due to additive genetic variation, since the reciprocal hybrid values were generally not significantly different from the mid-parent value. Although our data do not support the use of crossbreeding as a method for exploiting hybrid vigour in Chinook salmon, we do show that significant improvement in performance may result from the inclusion of ""wild"" gametes in a breeding program; however, some performance losses may also result. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.",Fecundity | Genetic | Growth | Heterosis | Performance | Stress | Survival,46,0,,BC,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

While elevated levels have been correlated with the increased energetic demand of raising offspring, elevated CORT levels have traditionally been implicated in reproductive abandonment. We examined the relationship between CORT and nest desertion in breeding wild female European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) incorporating analyses of both total circulating levels and 'free', unbound CORT through analysis of corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG). Free baseline CORT levels of nest-abandoning birds were significantly higher than nonabandoning birds within each stage, with chick-rearing birds exhibiting the highest free baseline CORT levels, while concurrently remaining the most resistant stage to nest desertion. Elevated free baseline CORT levels in chick-rearing birds were not due to increased total CORT secretion, but rather to a decrease in CBG levels. Overall, our results suggest that CORT and CBG interact to play a role in mediating the increased energetic demand of offspring, while minimizing the chances of nest desertion, thereby alleviating any potential behavioral conflict for CORT during reproduction. Furthermore, these results demonstrate that the traditional view of the role of CORT during reproduction is much more complex than previously appreciated. Together with mounting evidence, we suggest that elevated corticosteroid levels are an inherent and necessary part of reproduction in nonmammalian tetrapods. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Haematocrit in female European Starlings (Sturnus vulgaris Linnaeus) decreased between pre-breeding and egg-laying in 3 out of 4 years (the decrease was marginally non-significant in the fourth year). This was independent of changes in ambient temperature altering the metabolic requirements for thermoregulation. 3. There was a positive relationship between haematocrit and plasma levels of the yolk precursor vitellogenin among egg-laying birds, supporting the hypothesis that the initial reduction in haematocrit is caused by increased blood volume associated with osmoregulatory adjustments to elevated levels of yolk precursors. 4. However, haematocrit did not always recover upon cessation of egg production, remaining low a.t clutch completion (2 of 4 years), incubation (1 of 2 years) and chick rearing (1 of 4 years), suggesting an additional cause of the prolonged reduction in haematocrit. 5.

In this study, the effect of treatment, family and the treatment-by-family interaction on freshwater survival, growth and immune function was examined in full-sib groups of diploid and heat- and pressure-shock induced triploid chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from five families. Heat and pressure were equally effective at inducing triploidy, and few differences between the two treatment groups in survival, growth and antibody response to intraperitoneal Listonella anguillarum (formerly Vibrio) vaccination were observed. While triploids had lower survival and poorer performance than diploids, significant differences occurred mainly during the early stages of development. Survival was mainly influenced by treatment (heat-shock, pressure-shock) and family (genotype), while growth characteristics and the immune response to vaccination were mainly influenced by family. Significant treatment-by-family interaction effects were also found; however, they explained a relatively low proportion of the total variation in survival and growth, but a large proportion of the variation in immune response. An extended effect of heat-shock treatment on survival was present even after the onset of exogenous feeding. Despite the presence of significant interaction effects, consistent performance ranking among families was generally evident, regardless of ploidy or treatment.

The model was tested in a 20m water column in Lake Ontario using chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytcsha) and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) as predator and prey species, respectively. Prey availability was assessed using acoustic techniques, while temperature was measured with a temperature-depth profiler. Chinook growth rate potential was significantly greater during June than during other sampled months. The latter months supported little to no chinook growth potential as a result of low overlap in conditions supporting growth. On a diel scale, chinook growth rate potential was typically greater during crepuscular and night periods than during the day. Results reveal that both short and long term variability of prey density and thermal structure impose stringent limits to fish growth potential and production, and that fish grow well only over finite periods. The temporally explicit model provides quantitative predictions of fish production potential as influenced by temporal changes in habitat quality and/or climatic conditions. In light of recent modifications to both local and regional climate conditions, and the localised nature of fish harvesting practices, this model can assist in setting realistic production estimates and future potential harvesting quotas. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Apoptosis thus may provide the basis for developing biomarkers for use in the field of ecotoxicology to monitor non-lethal levels of xenobiotic induced cellular stress and toxicity. This study shows that a brown bullhead (Ameiurus nebulosus) fibroblast cell line (BB-2) responds to known apoptotic inducers (staurosporine, cycloheximide, and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)), as characterized by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP digoxigenin nick end-labelling (TUNEL). Furthermore, we characterized the apoptotic process using a series of newly identified bullhead genetic markers. Exposure to protein kinase C inhibitors altered the transcription of TF-cell apoptosis-related protein (TFAR)-15 and p23 with no effect on p53, inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP), or PNAS-2.

This problem is particularly acute in studies of nonindigenous species, which alternatively have been called 'exotic', 'introduced', 'invasive' and 'naturalised', among others. Attempts to redefine commonly used terminology have proven difficult because authors are often partial to particular definitions. In an attempt to form a consensus on invasion terminology, we synthesize an invasional framework based on current models that break the invasion process into a series of consecutive, obligatory stages. Unlike previous efforts, we propose a neutral terminology based on this framework This 'stage-based' terminology can be used to supplement terms with ambiguous meanings (e.g. invasive, introduced, naturalized, weedy, etc.), and thereby improve clarity of future studies. This approach is based on the concept of 'propagule pressure' and has the additional benefit of identifying factors affecting the success of species at each stage. Under this framework, invasions can be more objectively understood as biogeographical, rather than taxonomic, phenomena; and author preferences in the use of existing terminology can be addressed. An example of this recommended protocol might be: 'We examined distribution data to contrast the characteristics of invasive species (stages IVa and V) and noninvasive species (stages III and IVb)'.",Biological invasions | Definitions | Establishment | Exotic | Introduction | Invasion stages | Naturalized | NIS | Nonindigenous species | Terminology,514,0,,undefined,

The dispersal pattern in E. ischnus is very similar to that in the Ponto-Caspian cladoceran Cercopagis pengoi.

Many freshwater zooplankton produce diapausing eggs capable of withstanding periods of adverse environmental conditions, such as anoxia, drought and extreme temperature. These eggs may also allow oligostenohaline species to survive increased salinity during periods of tidal flux or evaporation, and here we test the ability of diapause eggs to withstand such conditions. 2. Salinity tolerance may also enable organisms to invade new environments. The increased rate of introduction of non-indigenous species to the Laurentian Great Lakes since 1989, when ballast water exchange regulations (to replace fresh/brackish water at sea with full seawater) were first implemented for transoceanic vessels, has stimulated studies that explore mechanisms of introduction, other than of active animals, in ballast water. One hypothesis proposes that freshwater organisms transported in ballast tanks as diapausing eggs may be partially responsible for the increased rate of species introduction, as these eggs may tolerate a wide array of adverse environmental conditions, including exposure to saline water. 3. We collected ballast sediments from transoceanic vessels entering the Great Lakes, isolated diapausing eggs of three species (Bosmina liederi, Daphnia longiremis and Brachionus calyciflorus), and measured the effect of salinity on hatching rate. In general, exposure to salinity significantly reduced the hatching rate of diapausing eggs. However, as non-indigenous species can establish from a small founding population, it is unclear whether salinity exposure will be effective as a management tool.",Ballast water exchange | Biological invasion | Hatching rates | Resting eggs | Salinity tolerance,46,0,,undefined,

We analysed the dawn chorus songs and singing behaviour of males whose winter-flock dominance status we determined. We used correlation analysis to show that pitch shifts were accompanied by changes to other fine structural characteristics in song, including temporal and relative amplitude parameters. We also found that songs of socially dominant males and songs of their most subordinate flockmates could be distinguished using these methods by the way they performed a between-note frequency measure accompanying pitch shifts. That is, a ratio measure of the internote frequency interval remained constant for songs of high-ranking birds despite changes in absolute pitch, while low-ranking males sang a smaller ratio as they shifted to higher absolute pitches. These findings identify previously unrecognised variation in the songs of black-capped chickadees.

We arranged three loudspeakers in an equilateral triangle at the center of playback subjects' territories. After luring males to the first loudspeaker by broadcasting non-song vocalizations, we played songs from the remaining loudspeakers to simulate a countersinging interaction between two male intruders. During the interactions, one simulated intruder consistently overlapped the songs of the other, a behaviour thought to be a signal of directed aggression in songbirds. Territorial male chickadees discriminated between the simulated intruders by preferentially approaching the loudspeaker broadcasting the overlapping signal, suggesting that males eavesdrop on other males' countersinging interactions. Male responses to playback support the idea that overlapping is a more threatening signal than being overlapped. Responses varied with the dominance status of the subject.

Here we explore the consequences of overlapping and frequency matching during song contests of male black-capped chickadees, Poecile atricapillus. Using interactive playback, we engaged birds of high and low dominance status in vocal interactions with a simulated territorial intruder. The playback intruder either overlapped or avoided overlapping the subjects' songs and either matched or avoided matching the frequency of the subjects' songs. Individuals who were overlapped by the playback intruder showed higher variability in their song length and song timing than individuals who were not overlapped. Individuals who were frequency-matched by the playback intruder responded with more agitated responses (more flights and passes over the speaker and closer distances of closest approach) and spent more time farther away from the loudspeaker. We argue that the timing of song delivery and the choice of song type are distinct functional components of vocal interactions, where overlapping and matching songs are threatening signals that have separate consequences for opponent behaviour and song performance. High-ranking males responded at greater distances from the loudspeaker in all treatments and responded with lower agitation levels than low-ranking males.

Experimental trials consisted of four 30-min stages: (A) acclimation, (B) observer female chooses between two males, (C) observer female watches a model female interact with her nonpreferred male from stage B, and (D) observer female again chooses between the two males. Control trials were identical except that there was no model female in stage C. Females in both experimental and control trials spent significantly more time with the nonpreferred male in stage D than they had in stage B; thus, our experiment appeared to reveal no evidence of mate choice copying. There was, however, a significant positive relationship between the increase in the time that an observer female in experimental trials spent with her nonpreferred male in stage D and the number of interactions that she had previously observed between the model female and that male in stage C. A second experiment of similar design, where observer females were prevented from observing the model female and nonpreferred male interact in stage B, demonstrated that the behaviour of the observer female in the first experiment was not simply a response to changes in male behaviour in stage D.

How song structure might encode information about male quality, however, remains unclear. We studied the availability of cues to male social rank (a proxy indicator of male quality), within the acoustic structure of dawn chorus songs of male chickadees whose flock dominance status we determined the previous winter. We used analysis of variance and discriminant function analysis to demonstrate that five temporal, frequency or relative amplitude features of song can predict individual identity but not the category of social rank (dominant versus subordinate) to which individuals belong. After transmitting chickadee songs through the forest and re-recording them at four broadcast distances, we found that song structure continued to effectively predict singer identity by our statistical methods despite significant acoustic degradation for as long as songs remained audible (up to 80 m). In particular, the relative frequency interval between the two notes is both the most invariant between-male measure and among the most individually distinctive. We conclude the structure of dawn chorus songs could function across large distances to signal the identity of familiar singing males whose relative quality is known to the listener from other interactions (such as encounters within winter flocks).",,41,0,,undefined,

Recent attempts to predict invasions have focused on the supply of propagules of nonindigenous species to recipient ecosystems from source populations. Here we develop a spatially explicit ""gravity"" model to test this concept for Bythotrephes longimanus, a crustacean waterflea from Eurasia that is rapidly invading lakes in Ontario, Canada. The gravity model predicted spread of Bythotrephes based upon seven identified risk factors (e.g., use of contaminated fishing or boat anchor line) that may allow dispersal of either live individuals or their resting eggs from invaded to noninvaded lakes, as well as based on the spatial arrangement of invaded and noninvaded lakes in Ontario. Discriminant analysis of lake gravity scores successfully identified invasion status for 74% of 170 inland lakes. A retrospective analysis of 31 invaded lakes revealed that the order in which lakes were invaded was directly related to the magnitude of vector inflows from invaded sources. Analysis of the dominant vector inflow to each invaded lake revealed a ""stepping stone"" pattern in which at least five lakes were sequentially invaded from the source population in Lake Huron. One invaded lake (Muskoka) apparently served as an invasion ""hub,"" resulting in up to 18 additional direct and 17 indirect invasions. Species spread occurred via a combination of dominant, local diffusion (median distance 12.5 km) and rare, long-distance (> 100 km) dispersal. Eleven of 131 lakes that were not invaded in 2000 were reported invaded in 2001. Gravity scores of these lakes were significantly higher than those of other noninvaded systems, indicating that susceptibility to invasion can be related to the magnitude of vector inflows. A GIS model based on gravity scores indicated that distribution of Bythotrephes is expected to expand to eastern and northwestern Ontario, although most new invasions are expected to occur in the central region of the province. Our results indicate that quantitative analysis of human dispersal vectors provides a robust starting point with which to assess vulnerability of discrete ecosystems to invasion. Management efforts focused on reducing the number and magnitude of human-mediated dispersal vectors may reduce the rate of invasion of new ecosystems.","Biological invasion | Bythotrephes | Crustacean, waterflea | GIS | Gravity model | Great Lakes | Long-distance dispersal | Nonindigenous species | Spatially explicit | Zooplankton",91,0,,undefined,

Initially, it was proposed that ultrasound detection in shad involves the auditory bullae, swim bladder extensions found in all members of the Clupeiformes. However, while all clupeiformes have bullae, not all can detect ultrasound. Thus, the bullae alone are not sufficient to explain ultrasound detection. In this study, we used a developmental approach to determine when ultrasound detection begins and how the ability to detect ultrasound changes with ontogeny in American shad. We then compared changes in auditory function with morphological development to identify structures that are potentially responsible for ultrasound detection. We found that the auditory bullae and all three auditory end organs are present well before fish show ultrasound detection behaviourally and we suggest that an additional specialization in the utricle (one of the auditory end organs) forms coincident with the onset of ultrasound detection. We further show that this utricular specialization is found in two clupeiform species that can detect ultrasound but not in two clupeiform species not capable of ultrasound detection. Thus, it appears that ultrasound-detecting clupeiformes have undergone structural modification of the utricle that allows detection of ultrasonic stimulation.",Alosa sapidissima | American shad | Bullae | Ultrasound detection | Utricle,34,1,,undefined,

However, more than 90% of vessels that entered during the 1990s declared no ballast on board (NOBOB) and were not required to exchange ballast, although their tanks contained residual sediments and water that would be discharged in the Great Lakes. Lake Superior receives a disproportionate number of discharges by both BOB and NOBOB ships, yet it has sustained surprisingly few initial invasions.

Also, reproductive females swam significantly faster than non-reproductive females, suggesting that reproductive male odour may have activated spawning behaviour. Olfactory epithelial field potential measurement (electro-olfactogram, EOG) showed that reproductive male water was a potent olfactory stimulus to reproductive females, but not to non-reproductive females. Reproductive females responded significantly more than non-reproductive females to solid-phase (octadecylsilane) extracts of reproductive male water.

Between 1999 and 2001, a decrease in the abundance of dominant members of the Lake Ontario zooplankton community (Daphnia retrocurva, Bosmina longirostris and Diacyclops thomasi) coincided with an increase in the abundance of Cercopagis. Daphnia retrocurva populations declined despite high fecundity in all 3 years, indicating that food limitation was not responsible. Chlorophyll a concentration generally increased, concomitant with a decline in the herbivorous cladoceran zooplankton in the lake. 3. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that Cercopagis fed on small-bodied species including D. retrocurva and B. longirostris. 4.

We assessed pheromonal communication through physiological (electro-olfactogram, EOG) and behavioral responses of females to water conditioned by males. Reproductive (R) females responded with larger amplitude EOGs to water conditioned by (R) males compared with non-reproductive (NR) males. The R females reacted by directed movement to water conditioned by R males compared to untreated water, but not to water from NR males or females. We are isolating odorous compounds from this conditioned water by fractionating non-aqueous components, and testing for olfactory (EOG) potency. The R females showed strong EOG responses to a subset of HPLC fractions collected from water conditioned by R males, but not to NR male fractions; and the R male fractions were not stimulatory to N females. We have initiated identification of the pheromonal source through in-vitro incubation of testicular cells with tritiated substrates. Seven metabolites were formed from androstenedione in the testis. One of these (albeit in a low proportion) was recognized as etiocholanolone. However, the HPLC elution position with maximal EOG activity did not with the elution position of this steroid (and all but one of the unidentified metabolites).

Polychlorinated biphenyls appear to alter nestling development through both maternally and paternally mediated effects. In I998, F0 parent kestrels consumed approximately 5 to 7 μg total PCBs/g bird/d (Aroclors® 1248:1254: 1260) for approximately 100 d prior to eggs hatching; these eggs, containing total PCB concentrations of 34.1 μg/g, produced 13 F1 offspring, which were then paired in 1999 with unexposed kestrels to examine developmental effects of maternal or paternal in ovo PCB exposure. Using a toxicokinetics model, eggs from the maternally exposed group had predicted PCB levels of 0.03 to 0.34 μg/g, with enriched higher chlorinated congeners. Polychlorinated biphenyl concentrations in eggs of all generations have recently been found in eggs and nestlings of free-ranging eagles. Consistent with the first generation, maternally exposed F2 females generally were larger, had altered growth rates, and delayed maximal growth and fledging compared with control females. Maternally exposed F2 males were heavier but had shorter bones, grew more quickly and earlier, and fledged 2 d later than control males. In the maternally exposed group, concentrations of plasma triiodothyronine were elevated in F2 females but suppressed in F2 males. Paternally exposed F2 hatchlings of both sexes were comparable in size to controls with the exception of having longer tarsi bones, but subsequently showed slower, delayed growth (both sexes) and fledging (females) and lower thyroxine concentrations (males). The alterations in thyroid hormones in the F2 generation are discussed in light of the enrichment of higher chlorinated PCB congeners and hydroxylated PCB congeners. The developmental changes in the kestrel nestlings are likely a function of several possible mechanisms involving maternal PCB deposition, parental behavior, and neurobehavioral and endocrine-thyroid function in nestlings.",Bird | Development | Growth | In ovo exposure | Polychlorinated biphenyls,9,0,,undefined,

A 45-kD protein immunoreactive to Golf, a cAMP-dependent olfactory G protein, was present in the ciliary fraction of sea lamprey olfactory epithelium and in olfactory sensory neurons of larval and adult sea lampreys. This result implies that Golf expression was present during early vertebrate evolution or evolved in parallel in gnathostome and agnathostome vertebrates. Serial sectioning of the olfactory bulb revealed a consistent pattern of olfactory glomeruli stained by GS1B4 lectin and by anterograde labeling with fluorescent dextran. These glomerular territories included the dorsal cluster, dorsal ring, anterior plexus, lateral chain, medial glomeruli, ventral ring, and ventral cluster. The dorsal, anterior, lateral, and ventral glomeruli contained olfactory sensory axon terminals that were Golf-immunoreactive. However, a specific subset, the medial glomeruli, did not display this immunoreactivity. Olfactory glomeruli in the dorsal hemisphere of the olfactory bulb, the dorsal cluster, dorsal ring, anterior plexus, lateral chain, and medial glomeruli, were seen adjacent to 5HT-immunoreactive fibers. However, glomeruli in the ventral hemisphere, the ventral ring, and ventral cluster did not display this association.

Recently this method has been called into question and estimation of the effective population size (Ne) proposed as a complementary method to determine population health. We examined genetic diversity in five populations of chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) from the upper Fraser River watershed (British Columbia, Canada) at 11 microsatellite loci over 20 years using DNA extracted from archived scale samples. We tested for changes in genetic diversity, calculated the ratio of the number of alleles to the range in allele size to give the statistic M, calculated Ne from the temporal change in allele frequency, used the maximum likelihood method to calculate effective population size (NeM), calculated the harmonic mean of population size, and compared these statistics to annual census estimates. Over the last two decades population size has increased in all five populations of chinook examined; however, Ne calculated for each population was low (81-691) and decreasing over the time interval measured. Values of NeM were low, but substantially higher than Ne calculated using the temporal method. The calculated values for M were generally low (M < 0.70), indicating recent population reductions for all five populations. Large-scale historic barriers to migration and development activities do not appear to account for the low values of Ne; however, available spawning area is positively correlated with Ne. Both Ne and M estimates indicate that these populations are potentially susceptible to inbreeding effects and may lack the ability to respond adaptively to stochastic events.

This is unfortunate because extinction plays a key role in determining the patterns of species richness seen in extant clades, which form the basis of comparative studies into the role that sexual selection may play in promoting speciation. We investigate the extent to which the perceived risk of extinction relates to four different estimates of sexual selection in 1030 species of birds. We find no evidence that the number of threatened species is distributed unevenly according to a social mating system, and neither of our two measures of pre-mating sexual selection (sexual dimorphism and dichromatism) was related to extinction risk, after controlling for phylogenetic inertia. However, threatened species apparently experience more intense post-mating sexual selection, measured as testis size, than non-threatened species. These results persisted after including body size as a covariate in the analysis, and became even stronger after controlling for clutch size (two known correlates of extinction risk). Sexual selection may therefore be a double-edged process - promoting speciation on one hand but promoting extinction on the other. Furthermore, we suggest that it is post-mating sexual selection, in particular, that is responsible for the negative effect of sexual selection on clade size. Why this might be is unclear, but the mean population fitness of species with high intensities of post-mating sexual selection may be especially low if costs associated with multiple mating are high or if the selection load imposed by post-mating selection is higher relative to that of pre-mating sexual selection.",Biodiversity | Conservation status | Dichromatism | Dimorphism | Species richness | Testis size,77,0,,undefined,

We quantified both ectoparasite load and the intensity of infection from blood parasites. In iridescent blue adult males, plumage reflectance is unimodal, with a single peak in the ultraviolet, while in greenish females and juveniles, plumage reflectance is bimodal, with peaks in both the ultraviolet and green portions of the spectrum. In adult males, the intensity of infection from blood parasites was best predicted by plumage brightness (total reflectance), with brighter males having fewer parasites.

To determine the mechanism underlying Spy1-induced proliferation in mammalian cell cycle regulation, we used human Spy1 as bait in a yeast two-hybrid screen to identify interacting proteins.

However, previous reports of bower orientation originate from studies conducted in open-canopy, sclerophyll forest, where diel variation in the intensity of light striking the bower is mostly influenced by the altitude and azimuth of the sun. We studied 12 Satin Bowerbird bowers in the mountainous rainforest of the Atherton Tablelands, Australia, and found no significant tendency for bower platforms to face north. Instead, bowers were invariably constructed near canopy gaps, and there was a significant tendency for bowers to face away from these gaps. We suggest that this pattern of orientation allows displaying males to be illuminated predominantly from the front when viewed by females from within the bower avenue. There was also a significant positive association between bower orientation and the orientation of the slope of the hill on which the bower was constructed, such that bowers were oriented upslope, further enhancing frontal illumination. We suggest that Satin Bowerbirds may use a variety of means, including bower orientation, to achieve this objective.",,14,0,,undefined,

The hypothesis proposes that females should be more willing to accept a mate when the new male encountered is a superior genetic source to previous mates. We provide a direct test of the trade-up hypothesis using guppies (Poecilia reticulata), and evaluate both behavioural and paternity data. Virgin female guppies were presented sequentially with two males of varying attractiveness, and their responsiveness to each male was quantified. Male attractiveness (ornamentation) was scored as the amount of orange coloration on their body. Females were generally less responsive to second-encountered males, yet responsiveness to second males was an increasing function of male ornamentation. These attractive second males also sired a greater proportion of the offspring. There was an overall tendency for last-male advantage in paternity, and this advantage was most exaggerated when the second male was more ornamented than the first. Finally, we found that our estimate of relative sperm number did not account for any significant variation in paternity.

Palaeontological, phylogeographic, and molecular evidence suggests that the natural, multiple colonizations of the Caspian basin via transient connections with the Black Sea and other basins played an important role in shaping the diversity of Caspian fauna. Geographically isolated, conspecific Ponto-Caspian lineages that currently inhabit fragmented habitats in the Ponto-Caspian region show limited genetic divergence, implying geologically recent episodes of gene flow between populations during the Pliocene to Pleistocene. Several molluscan lineages in the Caspian Sea may have descended from Lake Pannon stock before the Late Miocene isolation of the Caspian depression, about 5.8 million years ago. Anthropogenic activities during the 20th century were responsible for a 1800-fold increase in the rate of establishment of new aquatic species in the Caspian Sea compared to the preceding two million years of natural colonization. The observed success of NIS invasions during the 20th century was due primarily to human-mediated transport mechanisms, which were dominated by shipping activities (44%). Human-mediated species transfer has been strongly asymmetrical, toward the Volga Delta and Caspian Sea from or through Black and Azov Seas. Global and regional trade, particularly that mediated by commercial ships, provides dispersal opportunities for nonindigenous invertebrates, indicating that future invasions in the Caspian Sea are anticipated.",Interchange | Invasion | Molecular clock | Nonindigenous species | Palaeogeography | Ponto-Caspian | Stocking,63,0,,undefined,

However, the evolution of multicomponent sexual signals remains poorly understood, and past research on this type of signaling has been largely theoretical. Satin bowerbirds, Ptilonorhynchus violaceus, are polygynous, are sexually dichromatic, and construct sexually selected display structures (bowers): a model system for investigating the evolution and signal function of multiple sexual signals. We studied the interrelationship between bower features, plumage coloration, and indicators of male quality in this species. To do this, we located the bowers of male satin bowerbirds in rainforest in Queensland, Australia, and quantified bower quality. We captured the male bower owners and used reflectance spectrometry to objectively measure the plumage coloration of several body regions. We measured various indicators of male health and condition, including the intensity of infection from ectoparasites and blood parasites. Bower quality and male ultraviolet plumage coloration were significantly correlated. By using multiple regression analyses, we show that bower quality predicts ectoparasite load and body size, whereas ultraviolet plumage coloration predicts the intensity of infection from blood parasites, feather growth rate, and body size. Our findings support the multiple messages hypothesis of multicomponent signals: Female satin bowerbirds should assess both male and bower features to choose the highest quality mates.",Bowerbirds | Bowers | Honest advertisement | Multiple ornaments | Parasites | Plumage color | Sexual selection | Structural colors,132,1,,undefined,

Sockeye salmon return to the Klukshu River in two distinct runs, with a small 'early run' in June-August, and a larger 'late run' in August-September. A maximum likelihood test for clusters indicated that the return frequency distribution was bimodal in all the years analysed. Life history differences (fork length, sex ratio, age at maturity, fresh- and saltwater residency times) were found between the early and late runs; however, inconsistent patterns suggest that environmental effects outweigh, or strongly interact with, genetic effects for the life history characters evaluated. Analysis of variation at eight microsatellite loci showed that the early and late runs are genetically differentiated in all years examined (exact test). FST estimates between runs within years were significantly greater than zero (range: 0.018-0.041) for all years except one (0.004). The genetic variance explained by early vs. late runs (2.27%) was twice the variance among years (1.16%) based on analysis of molecular variance. Our neighbour-joining tree showed early and late runs generally clustering separately, indicating higher gene flow among the early or late run fish across years relative to between-run gene flow. Two years did not fit the general clustering pattern; although the early and late runs in 1995 and 2000 were genetically differentiated, they clustered separately from the rest of the groups. We cannot offer a definitive explanation for these anomalies; however, an analysis of possible cryptic population structure in early and late runs indicated that at least a few fish strayed between the runs in each year, and the highest rate of mixing was in 1995 and 2000. Our data indicate that the runs are at least partially reproductively isolated as a result of temporal and/or spatial isolating mechanisms.

The spatial organization of the nasal cavity in the bottom-dwelling round goby (Gobiidae, Neogobius melanostomus) was examined using impression material injection, immunocytochemistry, and transmission electron microscopy. The olfactory chamber contains a single olfactory lamella; prominent dorsocaudal lachrymal and ethmoidal accessory nasal sacs are situated ventrocaudal to the chamber. The location of the olfactory mucosa within the olfactory chamber is novel for teleost fish, as it extends beyond the ventral surface to the lateral and dorsal regions. Microvillar olfactory sensory neurons and ciliated olfactory sensory neurons were identified by transmission electron microscopy and the spatial distribution of these two cell types was assessed through immunocytochemistry against olfactory receptor coupled G-proteins. Both Gαolf-immunoreactive ciliated olfactory sensory neurons and the Gαo-immunoreactive microvillar form were located throughout the olfactory epithelium. Ciliated crypt cells were Gαo immunoreactive and were found throughout the olfactory epithelium of some specimens. The widespread occurrence of olfactory sensory neurons in the olfactory chamber supports the idea that olfactory signaling is important to the survival of the round goby. The prominence of the lachrymal and ethmoidal accessory nasal sacs indicates the capacity to regulate the flow of odorant molecules over the sensory surface of the olfactory sensory neurons, possibly through a pump-like mechanism driven by opercular activity associated with gill ventilation. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",G αo | G αolf | Immunocytochemistry | Round goby | Transmission electron microscopy,53,0,,undefined,

Fisherian models of sex allocation predict equal investment in males and females up to the end of parental care and predict brood compositions based on the relative costs of producing males and females. The Trivers-Wiliard hypothesis predicts that individual females should alter the sex ratio of their broods based on their own condition if it has a differential impact on the lifetime reproductive success of their sons and daughters. The Charnov model of sex allocation predicts that females should alter sex allocation based on paternal attributes that may differentially benefit sons versus daughters. Because females are the heterogametic sex in birds, many recent studies have focussed on primary sex ratio biases. In black-capped chickadees Poecile atricapilla, males are larger than females suggesting they may be more costly to raise than females. Female condition affects competitive ability in contests for mates, and thus may be related to variance in fecundity. Females prefer high-ranking males as both social and extrapair partners. These observations suggest that females might vary the sex ratio of their broods based on the predictions of any of the above models. Here, we report on the results of PCR based sex determination of 1093 nestlings in 175 broods sampled from 1992 to 2001.

Although this provides dispersal opportunities for nonindigenous species (NIS), relatively few NIS were initially discovered in this lake prior to being recorded elsewhere in the basin. A lack of NIS records from this lake may be an artefact of sampling bias. We tested this hypothesis by sampling benthos and plankton from littoral and deepwater habitats around the perimeter of Lake Superior during June and August 2001. Using morphological analysis techniques, we identified a total of 230 invertebrate taxa representing planktonic, benthic and nektonic lifestyles. Five species with invasion histories in the lower Great Lakes, the bivalves Sphaerium corneum, Pisidium amnicum and P. moitessierianum, gastropod Potamopyrgus antipodarum and amphipod Echinogammarus ischnus, were identified for the first time in Lake Superior. In addition, records of expanded distributions within this lake are presented for the amphipod Gammarus fasciatus and oligochaetes Ripistes parasita and Vejdovskyella intermedia. Recently introduced NIS in Lake Superior were found near international ports, implicating shipping as the vector of their introduction.

Among the several classes of ubiquitin E3 ligases, the Skp1-Cullin-F-box (SCF) class is generally comprised of three 'core' subunits: Skp1 and Cullin, plus at least one F-box protein (FBP) subunit that imparts specificity for the ubiquitination of selected target proteins. Recent genetic and biochemical evidence in Arabidopsis thaliana suggests that post-translational turnover of proteins mediated by SCF complexes is important for the regulation of diverse developmental and environmental response pathways. In this report, we extend upon a previous annotation of the Arabidopsis Skp1-like (ASK) and FBP gene families to include the Cullin family of proteins. Analysis of the protein interaction profiles involving the products of all three gene families suggests a functional distinction between ASK proteins in that selected members of the protein family interact generally while others interact more specifically with members of the F-box protein family. Analysis of the interaction of Cullins with FBPs indicates that CUL1 and CUL2, but not CUL3A, persist as components of selected SCF complexes, suggesting some degree of functional specialization for these proteins. Yeast two-hybrid analyses also revealed binary protein interactions between selected members of the FBP family in Arabidopsis.

We investigated a potential signal function of the achromatic black and white plumage of black-capped chickadees (Poecile atricapilla). We captured and color-banded 178 free-living chickadees and assessed winter flock dominance hierarchies by tabulating pairwise interactions at feeders. We recaptured 73 of these birds and measured plumage coloration for six body regions using a reflectance spectrometer and the area of melanin-based plumage patches from standardized photographs. We found extensive individual variation in chickadee plumage traits and considerable sexual dichromatism. Male black-capped chickadees have significantly brighter white plumage than females, larger black patches, and greater plumage contrast between adjacent white and black plumage regions. We also found rank differences in the plumage reflectance of males; high-ranking males, who are preferred by females as both social and extra-pair partners, exhibit significantly darker black plumage and grow their feathers more rapidly than low-ranking males.

To investigate the role of CSN in flower development, we examined the expression pattern of CSN in developing flowers. We report here that two csn1 partially deficient Arabidopsis strains exhibit aberrant development of floral organs, decline of APETALA3 (AP3) expression, and low fertility in addition to defects in shoot and inflorescence meristems. We show that UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO) forms a SCFUFO complex, which is associated with CSN in vivo. Genetic interaction analysis indicates that CSN is necessary for the gain-of-function activity of the F-box protein UFO in AP3 activation and in floral organ transformation. Compared with the previously reported csn5 antisense and csn1 null mutants, partial deficiency of CSN1 causes a reduction in the level of CUL1 in the mutant flowers without an obvious defect in CUL1 deneddylation.

Surveys conducted in Lake Erie between 1995 and 1998 revealed that Echinogammarus was the dominant amphipod on rocks covered by Dreissena molluscs compared with those fouled by the filamentous alga Cladophora, while Gammarus fasciatus used both Dreissena and Cladophora substrata extensively. 3. In laboratory habitat selection studies, Echinogammarus chose Dreissena- over Cladophora-encrusted rocks and bare rocks, while Gammarus occupied the more complex substrata equally. 4. Field colonisation experiments demonstrated that the densities of Echinogammarus and Gammarus were positively correlated when the total density of the species was low, in contrast to the large-scale natural distribution of the species that revealed a strong inverse relationship. 5. The on-going replacement of Gammarus by Echinogammarus in the Laurentian Great Lakes may be related to the stronger affinity of the latter for substrata fouled by Dreissena, a genus with which it co-evolved.",Amphipods | Competitive displacement | Exotic species | Habitat selection | Lake Erie,62,0,,undefined,

To understand the biochemical pathways controlling this differential response, we have studied the intracellular localization of cyclin B1 in cell types sensitive or resistant to apoptosis induced by DNA damage. We found that cyclin B1 protein accumulates in the nucleus of cells that are sensitive to γ radiation-induced apoptosis (thymocytes, lymphoid cell lines), but remains cytoplasmic in apoptosis-resistant cells (primary and transformed fibroblasts). Treatment of both cell types with leptomycin B, an inhibitor of CRM1-dependent cyclin B1 nuclear export, induces apoptosis. Furthermore, ectopic expression of cyclin B1-5xE, a protein that preferentially localizes to the nucleus, is sufficient to trigger apoptosis. Conversely, expression of cyclin B1-5xA, a predominantly cytoplasmic protein, fails to induce apoptosis. This suggests that nuclear accumulation is necessary for cyclin B1-dependent apoptosis. Our observations are consistent with the idea that localization of cyclin B1 is among the factors determining the cellular decision to undergo apoptosis in response to DNA damage. © 2003 by The American Society of Hematology.",,52,1,,undefined,

These measures were obtained for 1031 species representing 467 genera. None of the variables investigated explained the patterns of species richness. As sexual selection may also increase extinction rates, the net effect on species richness in any given clade will depend on the balancing effects of sexual selection upon speciation and extinction rates.

A careful analysis of the morphologies of Hox mutant mice suggests that the genes provide qualitatively different cues during the specification of segments than they do during the development of more recently derived structures. In addition to the regulatory differences noted by others, the activity of Hox genes during specification of the vertebrate metameres in some recent deletion experiments is inconsistent with a role for them as strictly spatial determinants. On the contrary, the phenotypes observed are suggestive of a role for them as elements of a generic time-keeping mechanism. By contrast, the specification of more recent evolutionary structures appears to be more spatial and gene-specific. These differences in role and effect may suggest some simple mechanisms by which the Hox clusters operate, and rules by which gene networks can be diverted to create new structures over the course of evolution.

Baseline levels of corticosterone increased significantly during post-natal development and although chicks aged 10- and 16-days old exhibited comparable baseline corticosterone levels, those of 22-day-old chicks were significantly higher and those of 28-day-old chicks close to fledging were higher than all younger groups. Chicks in this study exhibited low levels of stress-induced corticosterone early in development and did not exhibit adult-type stress-induced levels of corticosterone until 22 days of age post-hatching. Finally, although baseline and stress-induced levels of 28-day-old birds were significantly higher than one-year-old adults, there was no relationship between baseline corticosterone concentrations and time to nest departure. The fact that baseline levels of corticosterone are low during early development and then increase during later development may be an adaptation to the negative effects of chronically elevated corticosterone levels and as previously noted in other studies may minimize these negative effects on rapid growth and development in young birds, potentially maximizing normal growth.

Teleost fishes represent useful models for developmental investigations of the auditory system due to their often extensive period of posthatching development and the diversity of auditory specializations in this group. Using the auditory brainstem response and morphological techniques we investigated the development of auditory form and function in zebrafish (Danio rerio) ranging in size from 10 to 45 mm total length. We found no difference in auditory sensitivity, response latency, or response amplitude with development, but we did find an expansion of maximum detectable frequency from 200 Hz at 10 mm to 4000 Hz at 45 mm TL. The expansion of frequency range coincided with the development of Weberian ossicles in zebrafish, suggesting that changes in hearing ability in this species are driven more by development of auxiliary specializations than by the ear itself. We propose a model for the development of zebrafish hearing wherein the Weberian ossicles gradually increase the range of frequencies available to the inner ear, much as middle ear development increases frequency range in mammals. © 2003 Acoustical Society of America.",,75,0,,undefined,

The model consists of two components, a bioenergetics model that predicts the lipid mass balance of embryo and yolk compartments with time and an empirical toxicokinetic model that describes PCB partitioning between lipid compartments in the egg. The model was calibrated using data on PCB and lipid partitioning between embryo and yolk + albumen at four time points during incubation in herring gull eggs injected with a PCB mixture, combined with data sets on herring gull embryo growth rates and bioenergetic demands with time. The model was validated using independent data consisting of maternally exposed, field-incubated Lake Superior herring gull eggs that varied in incubation ages over the range of 8.5 d to pipping age (26-28 days). PCB concentrations in 6-9 d embryos were nearly an order of magnitude less than predicted by equilibrium lipid partitioning between the embryo and yolk+albumen compartments of the eggs. PCB concentrations in embryos were adequately predicted by equilibrium partitioning, however, for eggs incubated for 23-28 d. An empirical relationship was developed to account for the apparent non-equilibrium behaviour of PCBs during early development. The model was sensitive to the mass of yolk lipids and the mass of PCBs deposited to fresh eggs and much of the variability in embryo PCB concentrations could by explained by accounting for variability in these input parameters. Consistent with experimental data for other avian species, the model predicts that the highest PCB concentrations in the embryo/chick occur during pipping or soon after when yolk lipids have been completely resorbed by the embryo.",Bioenergetics | Embryo | Herring gull | Lifecycle models | Toxicokinetics,22,0,,undefined,

Nine captive male American kestrels previously exposed to a PCB mixture (Aroclor™1248:1254:1260; 1:1:1) in their diet were subjected to a standardized capture, handling and restraint protocol designed to produce an increase in circulating corticosterone. A similar protocol has been applied to a wide range of avian species and was used here to evaluate the response of PCB-exposed and control kestrels to a defined physical stressor. Both baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels were significantly lower in PCB-exposed birds when compared with control birds of the same age. PCB-exposed birds exhibited significantly lower corticosterone levels during the corticosterone response when compared with control birds, independent of body condition. Furthermore, baseline corticosterone concentrations exhibited a hormetic response characterized by an inverted U-shaped dose response in relation to total PCB liver burden, These results support several recent studies which report decreased levels of circulating corticosterone in PCB-exposed wild birds. The results presented here provide the first evidence that exposure to an environmentally relevant level of PCBs (approximately 10 mg/kg body weight) can impair the corticosterone stress response in kestrels, potentially increasing the susceptibility of birds to environmental stressors such as severe weather and predatory and human disturbance.",American kestrel | Corticosterone | Hormesis | Hypothalamo-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis | Polychlorinated biphenyl,37,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Sublethal doses of DDT (923 ng/g wet wt), malathion (990 ng/g wet wt), and dieldrin (50 ng/g wet wt) were used in the injection study. In all pesticide-injected groups, antibody response was dramatically suppressed, DTH reactions were enhanced, and respiratory burst was lower. When the order of administration of pesticides and antigens was reversed, no differences in immune function between the control and dosed groups were apparent, indicating that frogs exposed to pathogens prior to pesticide exposure can still respond. A field study found significant differences in immune function between frog populations in pesticide-exposed and pesticide-free locations. The antibody response and CL were suppressed and the DTH enhanced in frogs from Essex County (ON, Canada).

Each of these regulatory steps represents a potential target for controlling cell proliferation. Accumulation of threshold levels of cyclin B1 protein at the G2/M transition requires the cooperation of various promoter elements, possibly the activation of several transcription factors, enhanced cyclin B1 mRNA stability and, in some cases, translational activation of dormant mRNA. Binding of cyclin B1 to its inactive partner, CDK1, initiates conformational changes allowing CDK1 to alter its phosphorylation status and to become an active kinase. Lastly, the active cyclin B1-CDK1 complex must translocate to the nucleus to begin phosphorylating nuclear substrates. These phosphorylation events are necessary for mitotic onset. While cyclin B1 is capable of shuttling from the nucleus to the cytoplasm throughout interphase, mitotic onset requires phosphorylation of cyclin B1 within the CRS region, thereby enhancing import and inhibiting export of the cyclin B1-CDK1 complex. Elucidating the role of mediators controlling cyclin B1-CDK1 translocation at the onset of mitosis is essential in developing drug targets for cell cycle control.",,150,0,,undefined,

Elimination rates of PCBs were determined in birds dosed with an Aroclor mixture (1242:1248:1260, 1:1:1) and allowed to depurate on uncontaminated high-lipid or low-lipid/high-fiber diets for 105 days. Uptake rates for seven additional PCBs not found within the above Aroclor mixtures were studied in the same birds by feeding high- or low-lipid PCB-spiked diets for 15 days. The two diet treatments contributed to differences in feeding rates, fecal egestion rates, and total fat volume of the birds. Uptake rate constants of PCBs were higher for the low-lipid diet group, whereas PCB assimilation efficiencies were similar between the two groups. Whole-body elimination rates of Aroclor PCBs were most strongly influenced by the chlorine substitution pattern of the congeners, such that PCBs containing an open meta-para site on one of the phenyl rings were rapidly cleared from the animal. Whole-body elimination rates for persistent PCBs could only be determined for PCB 28; other congeners exhibited negligible elimination over the depuration period. For the latter compounds, fecal elimination rates were estimated using the excreta/carcass distribution coefficient and excreta production rates. For PCB 28, the fecal elimination rate was similar to the whole-body elimination rate, suggesting that fecal elimination of persistent PCBs dominates whole body elimination of these compounds. Diet treatment effects were less evident for PCB elimination rates compared to uptake rates. Steady-state biomagnification factors were estimated to range from 1.0 to 5.1 for rapidly cleared PCBs and from 27 to 97 for persistent congeners.",,41,0,,undefined,

Here we examine sibling variation in adrenocortical function in postnatally developing, asynchronously hatching American kestrels (Falco sparverius) by measurements of baseline and stress-induced levels of corticosterone at ages 10, 16, 22, and 28 days posthatching. There was a significant effect of hatching order on both baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels during development and these effects grew stronger through development. First-hatched chicks exhibited higher baseline levels than later-hatched chicks throughout development and higher stress-induced levels during the latter half of development. Furthermore, there was significant hatching span (difference in days between first- and last-hatched chicks) X hatching order interaction on both baseline and stress-induced corticosterone levels during development. Hatching span was also positively correlated with both measures of corticosterone and body mass in first-hatched chicks, but was negatively correlated with these factors through most of the development in last-hatched chicks. It is known that hatching asynchrony creates mass and size hierarchies within kestrel broods and we suggest that hierarchies in adrenocortical function among siblings may be one physiological mechanism by which these competitive hierarchies are maintained. © 2003 Elsevier Science (USA).

Results did not suggest competition for space. Since the outcome of competition may be influenced by order of establishment, we tested temporal overlap by adding Chironomus larvae to containers with Hexagenia nymphs at different stages in their development and vice versa (experiment 2). Newly-hatched mayflies showed the smallest increase in body length after being exposed to midges after 0 and 10 days, but exhibited no significant difference from the control after 20, 40, and 60 days of exposure to midges. In experiment 3, we tested if Hexagenia or Chironomus larvae ate mayfly eggs. Chironomus larvae significantly reduced the number of Hexagenia eggs at densities examined and we speculate that the reduction occurred because of egg consumption. In contrast, the number of eggs remaining in the presence of a Hexagenia nymph did not differ significantly from the control. We confirmed that midges were present in Lake Erie sediments when Hexagenia oviposit.

Generally, the proportion of eggs hatched in light and dark treatments did not differ significantly, indicating that light was not required to terminate diapause. As a result, eggs could potentially hatch in dark ballast tanks when immersed in freshwater loaded as ballast during operation on the Great Lakes. Viability of diapausing eggs differed among ballast tanks on a single vessel, indicating that tanks with independent ballast histories have different invasion risks. While additional work is needed to quantify risk, results from this study indicate that vessels entering the Great Lakes with only residual ballast are a potential vector for the introduction of new nonindigenous species during multiport operations.",,82,0,,undefined,

With the advent of molecular markers, it is now possible to detect multiple mating in nature. However, no model yet exists to effectively assess the frequency of multiple mating (fmm) - the proportion of broods with at least two males (or females) genetically contributing - from limited genetic data. We present a single-sex model based on Bayes' rule that incorporates the numbers of loci, alleles, offspring, and genetic parents. Two genetic criteria for calculating fmm are considered: the proportion of broods with three or more paternal (or maternal) alleles at any one locus and the total number of haplotypes observed in each brood. The former criterion provides the most precise estimates of fmm. The model enables the calculation of confidence intervals and allows mutations (or typing errors) to be incorporated into the calculation. Failure to account for mutations can result in overestimates of fmm. The model can also utilize other biological data, such as behavioral observations during mating, thereby increasing the accuracy of the calculation as compared to previous models. For example, when two sires contribute equally to multiply mated broods, only three loci with five equally common alleles are required to provide estimates of fmm with high precision. We demonstrate the model with an example addressing the frequency of multiple paternity in small versus large clutches of the endangered Kemp's Ridley sea turtle (Lepidochelys kempi) and show that females that lay large clutches are more likely to have multiply mated.",,24,1,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Propagule pressure of individual ships that enter the Great Lakes loaded with cargo and that declare ""no ballast on board"" (NOBOB) is typically one to two orders of magnitude higher than that of vessels that exchange ballast.

Mechanisms of introductions were dominated by deliberate releases (29%) and shipping activities (22%), with the former occurring principally in freshwater habitats and the latter in marine and estuarine ones. Other introductions resulted from unintentional release (21%) and hydrotechnical development (14%), notably the construction of reservoirs and canals.

Infertility may also be an inherent result of conflict over fertilization between the sexes in polyandrous species, either because too many sperm enter the egg or because of over-efficient barriers to such polyspermic fertilizations. We generated phylogenetic independent contrasts to examine the variation in hatching success for a maximum of 58 species of birds in relation to two measures of female polyandry. Hatching success varied enormously across species (range: 61-100%), with a mean of 12% of eggs failing to hatch, but was not related to either the rate of extrapair paternity or to relative testes size.

COI1E22A, a single amino acid substitution in the F-box motif of COI1, abolishes the formation of the SCFCOI1 complexes and results in loss of the JA response. AtRbx1 double-stranded RNA-mediated genetic interference reduces AtRbx1 expression and affects JA-inducible gene expression. Furthermore, we show that the AtCUL1 component of SCFCOI1 complexes is modified in planta, where mutations in AXR1 decrease the abundance of the modified AtCUL1 of SCFCOI1 and lead to a reduction in JA response. Finally, we demonstrate that the axr1 and coi1 mutations display a synergistic genetic interaction in the double mutant.

The early response can be selectively blocked by AMPA receptor antagonists (1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide disodium [NBQX]; or 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione) [CNQX], and the later one by NMDA receptor antagonists ((±)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid [CPP]; or (±)-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid) [APV]. Both AMPA and NMDA receptor-mediated responses can be elicited at resting potential, although the NMDA response is voltage dependent and makes a greater contribution when the cell membrane is depolarized. In vivo studies indicate that both AMPA and NMDA receptors contribute to sound-evoked responses. Both AMPA and NMDA receptor antagonists reduce the firing rate of single neurons in the ICC to contralaterally presented tones. Both classes of antagonist lower evoked activity over a wide range of sound intensities from threshold to maximum sound pressure levels. Thus, both NMDA and AMPA receptors contribute to responses over the full dynamic range of auditory sensitivity. The AMPA receptor antagonist, NBQX, is more effective than the NMDA receptor antagonist, CPP, in blocking responses of onset cells. Furthermore, NBQX and CPP have preferential effects in blocking the early or late responses of neurons that exhibited sustain activity to a 100 ms tone. Excitatory responses to sinusoidally amplitude-modulated stimuli are also reduced by application of either AMPA or NMDA antagonists. However, the synchrony of firing of action potentials to the modulation period (vector strength) is largely unaffected. The data suggest that the synchrony of firing of neurons in the inferior colliculus is determined primarily by the pattern of activity at lower levels of the auditory pathway and/or the local intrinsic properties of the cells. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Attempts to describe microbial communities by either traditional microbiological methods or molecular methods have been limited in both scale and precision. The availability of genomics technologies offers an unprecedented opportunity to conduct more comprehensive characterizations of microbial communities. Here we describe the application of an established molecular diagnostic method based on the chaperonin-60 sequence, in combination with high-throughput sequencing, to the profiling of a microbial community: the pig intestinal microbial community. Four libraries of cloned cpn60 sequences were generated by two genomic DNA extraction procedures in combination with two PCR protocols. A total of 1,125 cloned cpn60 sequences from the four libraries were sequenced. Among the 1,125 cloned cpn60 sequences, we identified 398 different nucleotide sequences encoding 280 unique peptide sequences. Pairwise comparisons of the 398 unique nucleotide sequences revealed a high degree of sequence diversity within the library. Identification of the likely taxonomic origins of cloned sequences ranged from imprecise, with clones assigned to a taxonomic subclass, to precise, for cloned sequences with 100% DNA sequence identity with a species in our reference database. The compositions of the four libraries were compared and differences related to library construction parameters were observed. Our results indicate that this method is an alternative to 16S rRNA sequence-based studies which can be scaled up for the purpose of performing a potentially comprehensive assessment of a given microbial community or for comparative studies.",,89,0,,undefined,

However, it is not clear whether the addition ever stops or how the addition of sensory cells impacts hearing ability. In this article, we tested both questions using the zebrafish, Danio rerio. Our results not only have important implications for understanding the consequences of adding sensory receptors, but these results for normal zebrafish also serve as valuable base-line information for future studies of select mutations on the ear and hearing of this species. Our results show that hair cell production continues in uncrowded zebrafish up to 10 months of age (about one-third of a normal life span), but despite this addition there is no change in hearing sensitivity or bandwidth. Therefore, hearing is not related to the number of sensory cells in the ear in juvenile and adult animals. We also show that despite no net addition of hair cells after about 10 months, hair cells are still being produced, but at a lower rate, presumably to replace cells that are dying. Moreover, crowding of zebrafish has a marked impact on the growth of the fish and on the addition of sensory cells to the ear.

This commitment is a critical one that is tightly regulated by many parallel pathways. Significantly, these pathways converge to result in activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase, cdk2. It is, therefore, important to understand all the mechanisms regulating cdk2 to determine the molecular basis of cell progression. Here we report the identification and characterization of a novel cell cycle gene, designated Speedy (Spy1). Spy1 is 40% homologous to the Xenopus cell cycle gene, X-Spy1. Similar to its Xenopus counterpart, human Speedy is able to induce oocyte maturation, suggesting similar biological characteristics. Spy1 mRNA is expressed in several human tissues and immortalized cell lines and is only expressed during the G1/S phase of the cell cycle. Overexpression of Spy1 protein demonstrates that Spy1 is nuclear and results in enhanced cell proliferation. In addition, flow cytometry profiles of these cells demonstrate a reduction in G1 population. Changes in cell cycle regulation can be attributed to the ability of Spy1 to bind to and prematurely activate cdk2 independent of cyclin binding. We demonstrate that Spy1-enhanced cell proliferation is dependent on cdk2 activation. Furthermore, abrogation of Spy1 expression, through the use of siRNA, demonstrates that Spy1 is an essential component of cell proliferation pathways. Hence, human Speedy is a novel cell cycle protein capable of promoting cell proliferation through the premature activation of cdk2 at the G1/S phase transition.",G1/S | Proliferation | Restriction point | siRNA | Speedy,64,1,,undefined,

It recently invaded 70 North American lakes, prompting a re-evaluation of the taxonomic status, global distribution, and determinants of local occurrence and abundance. European studies have reported two distinct species, B. longimanus, which lacks a kink on the caudal process, and B. cederstroemi, which possesses one. We employed sequencing of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome c oxidase subunit I (COI) in addition to Directed Amplification of Minisatellite-region DNA (DAMD) using polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) to assay the genetic nature of these 'species'. These analyses revealed that the two taxa are consistent with a single, common species, Bythotrephes longimanus Leydig 1860, thus resolving the nomenclatural issue. Furthermore, a common haplotype was identified between Lake Ontario and Lake Puruvesi, Finland, suggesting a potential invasion corridor via the nearby Baltic Sea. Statistical analysis revealed that the two forms also occur in similar habitats in Eurasia and North America. Habitat characteristics of water bodies in Northern Europe, where both forms are found and occasionally co-occur, do not differ statistically. Similarly, no significant differences were detected between characteristics of Eurasian habitats that support longimanus 'forms' and those of inland lakes in North America that support cederstroemi 'forms'. Human activities have had a strong effect on the distribution of Bythotrephes in both Europe and North America. Global and local distributions have been affected by ballast water transfer and by boating and fishing activities, respectively. Cultural eutrophication, oligotrophication and acidification alter the suitability of habitats for fish predators, and may indirectly influence Bythotrephes' local occurrence and abundance.",Acidification | Biological invasions | COI | DAMD | Distribution | DNA markers | Eutrophication | Fish predation | Non indigenous species (NIS),42,0,,undefined,

One family of proteins that plays a role in regulating actin remodeling in response to cellular signals are the cyclase-associated proteins (CAPs). CAPs are highly conserved monomeric actin binding proteins present in a wide range of organisms including yeast, fly, plants, and mammals. The original CAP was isolated as a component of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae adenylyl cyclase complex that serves as an effector of Ras during nutritional signaling. CAPs are multifunctional molecules that contain domains involved in actin binding, adenylyl cyclase association in yeast, SH3 binding, and oligomerization. Genetic studies in yeast have implicated CAPs in vesicle trafficking and endocytosis. CAPs play a developmental role in multicellular organisms, and studies of Drosophila have illuminated the importance of the actin cytoskeleton during eye development and in establishing oocyte polarity. This review will highlight the critical structural and functional domains of CAPs, describe recent studies that have implied important roles for these proteins in linking cell signaling with actin polymerization, and highlight their roles in vesicle trafficking and development. - Hubberstey, A.

In eastern Lake Erie (OH, USA), almost 100% of the chemical body burden of biota originates from sediment. In western Lake Erie, benthic invertebrates accumulated slightly more than half of their PCB body burden from sediment while fish accumulated less than half of their chemical body burden from sediment. Fish from Lake Ontario, Canada, accumulated less than 30% of their body burden of PCB congeners with log Kow < 6.4 from sediment and approximately half of their body burden of PCB congeners with log Kow ≥ 6.4 from sediment. Field data and the model were also used to determine the effects of declining concentrations of PCBs in water and sediment on concentrations of PCBs in aquatic biota. Results indicate that, as concentrations of PCB congeners in the ecosystem decline, the role of sediment as the source of contaminant to aquatic biota increases.

With access to broad new avenues of research come strategic and logistical headaches, most of which are embodied in the reams of data that are created over the course of an experiment. The solutions to these problems have provided interesting computational tools, which will allow us to compile huge data sets and to construct a genome-wide view of development.

The study was conducted within two active D. frontalis infestations in the Talladega National Forest in Alabama in July 1998. Stickem Special-coated 15 × 20 cm wire mesh (6 mm2) traps were placed on pines with late instar to adult D. frontalis and Ips spp. at 2 m intervals to a height of 16 m on 12 trees and at 4-m intervals to a height of 16 m on 6 trees. Traps were changed on alternate days for 14 d, and all adult parasitoids of the D. frontalis complex were identified and counted. There was a positive correlation between height and number of parasitoids. This is most likely due to the high proportion of Roptrocerus xylophagorum Ratzeburg and Heydenia unica Cook and Davis collected, because both of these species preferred the upper bole. Each parasitoid species had different height distributions. R. xylophagorum, H. unica and Dendrosoter sulcatus Muesebeck all preferred the upper bole, with a peak trap catch between 12 and 16 m. In contrast, Coeloides pissodis (Ashmead) and Dinotiscus dendroctoni (Ashmead) both preferred the midbole, with a peak catch at 6 m. Only Spathius pallidus Ashmead showed no height preference; however, this species also had the lowest trap catch.

The success of E1A antitumor therapy in animal models has led to its use in phase I and phase II clinical trials, where liposome-based delivery vehicles are being used to deliver a plasmid encoding E1A. To increase the efficiency of E1A delivery to tumors, we have developed an Ad vector deleted of all viral protein coding sequences (termed helper-dependent Ad vectors, hdAds) with the exception of E1A, designated hdAd-E1A. In culture, this vector mediated high-level expression of E1A gene products. A549 cells a human lung adenocarcinoma cell line, infected with hdAd-E1A showed a reduced proliferative capacity in adherent culture, and the ability to form colonies in soft agarose was completely abolished. In contrast, A549 infected with an hdAd expressing β-gal were able to form colonies of a similar size and frequency as uninfected cells. Under serum-depleted conditions, expression of E1A within A549 led to the induction of apoptosis. Finally, A549 cells treated with hdAd-E1A showed approximately 10-fold greater sensitivity to the chemotherapeutic drug cisplatin. Taken together, these data indicate that the use of hdAd provides a simple and effective method to deliver E1A to cancer cells, and results in reduction in the tumorigenic potential of the cells, as well as increasing the cells sensitivity to anticancer drugs.",Adenovirus | Cancer | E1A | Gene therapy,28,1,,undefined,Canadian Institutes of Health Research

Mature female chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha and eggs at key developmental stages were electroshocked with 10-s pulsed DC from a standard backpack electroshocker in a controlled environment. Eggs from one-third of the shocked females showed extreme mortality (>93%), while the remaining shocked families shared egg mortality (12-20%) similar to the controls (9.9%). Eggs shocked at the early eyed stage showed significantly higher mortality (34.2%) than control (unshocked) eggs, while mortalities were low (≤2.1%) for shocked eggs and for controls at all other developmental stages. Upon examination of fish radiographs, we found that the electroshocked juvenile fish had significantly more spinal aberrations than the unshocked fish. Hematocrit, serum cortisol and glucose, serum lysozyme activity, and total leukocyte counts were monitored in control and shocked juvenile fish for 3 weeks. Hematocrit declined over 3 weeks in both groups. Serum cortisol and glucose levels increased significantly in both groups within 12 h, but shocked fish showed a slower return of cortisol levels to preshock values and an overall higher glucose response. The combination of electroshock and handling did not affect serum lysozyme levels, but unshocked (handled) fish exhibited immediate and significantly reduced lysozyme activity for up to 2 weeks. Total leukocyte numbers were higher in shocked fish late in the experiment (at 2 and 3 weeks). Although electrofishing is useful to determine the precapture physiological status of field-caught fish, our data show that electrofishing can have significant detrimental impacts on the fish. © 2002 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,28,0,,undefined,

These kinases control cell cycle progression through the regulation of centrosome maturation and separation, mitotic entry, metaphase to anaphase transition, mitotic exit and cytokinesis. Plks are characterized by an N-terminal Ser/Thr protein kinase domain and the presence of one or two C-terminal regions of similarity, termed the polo box motifs. These motifs have been demonstrated for Cdc5 and Plk1 to be required for mitotic progression and for subcellular localization to mitotic structures. Here we report the 2.0 Å crystal structure of a novel domain composed of the polo box motif of murine Sak. The structure consists of a dimeric fold with a deep interfacial cleft and pocket, suggestive of a ligand-binding site. We show that this domain forms homodimers both in vitro and in vivo, and localizes to centrosomes and the cleavage furrow during cytokinesis.

We characterize the genetic component of this reproductive strategy using two approaches; hormonal phenotypic sex manipulation, and a half-sib breeding experiment. We 'masculinized' chinook salmon larvae with testosterone, reared them to first maturation, identified jacks and immature males based on phenotype, and genotyped all fish as male ('XY') or female ('XX') using PCR-based Y-chromosome markers. The XY males had a much higher incidence of jacking than the XX males (30.8% vs 9.9%). There was no difference in body weight, gonad weight, and plasma concentrations of testosterone and 17β-estradiol between the two jack genotypes, although XY jacks did have a higher gonadosomatic index (GSI) than XX jacks. In the second experiment, we bred chinook salmon in two modified half-sib mating designs, and scored the number of jacks and immature fish at first maturation. Heritability of jacking was estimated using two ANOVA models: dams nested within sires, and sires nested within dams with one-half of the half-sib families common to the two models. The sire component of the additive genetic variance yielded a high heritability estimate and was significantly higher than the dam component (hsire2 = 0.62 ± 0.21; hdam2 = -0.14 ± 0.12). Our experiments both indicated a strong sex-linked component (Y-chromosome) to jacking in chinook salmon, although evidence for at least some autosomal contribution was also observed.",Maternal effect | Satellite male | Sex linkage | Sex manipulation | Sexual maturation | Testosterone,51,1,,undefined,British Columbia Arts Council

Validated quantitative models of physical, chemical, and biological processes are the best way to project such impacts; however, time, data, and model limitations often make these approaches impractical. An alternative is to encode expert knowledge about interactions among ecosystem components in a fuzzy cognitive map (FCM), which then translates that subjective, qualitative information into predictions of the effects of management on an ecosystem. Herein, we present the steps involved in constructing an FCM of an ecosystem, interpreting FCM output using multivariate statistics, and portraying the information in an easily communicated fashion. To illustrate these ideas, we rely on a complex (>160 variables) ecosystem model built for the Lake Erie watershed under the auspices of the Lake Erie Lakewide Management Plan (LaMP). Based on our experiences in building this model, we also offer recommendations for increasing the efficiency of the model-development and interpretation process. Use of the FCM method in this case promoted constructive interaction among dozens of scientists, managers, and the public, as well as providing insights concerning the potential effects of broad classes of management actions upon the Lake Erie ecosystem. The analysis focused the attention of participants on four broad alternatives for the Lake. One represents present conditions, and another results from a decrease in nutrient inputs but an increase in stresses from land use and human disturbance. The two others involve reduced stress from nutrients and land use, with one having relatively more nutrients and less human disturbance and fishing. The latter ecosystem alternative was tentatively endorsed by LaMP management, and all four alternatives will be reviewed by the public.",Cluster analysis | Ecosystem management | Ecosystem modeling | Fisheries management | Fuzzy cognitive maps | Fuzzy sets | Lake Erie watershed | Principal components analysis,87,0,,undefined,

Although in plants, two different subclasses of TALE proteins include important developmental regulators, the existence of interactions between plant TALE proteins has remained unexplored. We have used the yeast two-hybrid system to demonstrate that the Arabidopsis BELL1 (BEL1) homeodomain protein can selectively heterodimerize with specific KNAT homeodomain proteins. Interaction is mediated by BEL1 sequences N terminal to the homeodomain and KNAT sequences including the MEINOX domain. These findings validate the hypothesis that the MEINOX domain has been conserved between plants and animals as an interaction domain for developmental regulators. In yeast, BEL1 and KNAT proteins can activate transcription only as a heterodimeric complex, suggesting a role for such complexes in planta. Finally, overlapping patterns of BEL1 and SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) expression within the inflorescence meristem suggest a role for the BEL1-STM complex in maintaining the indeterminacy of the inflorescence meristem.",,140,0,,undefined,

In contrast, the evolution of female mate choice in species exhibiting resource-free mating systems remains controversial. One such species in which males contribute nothing but sperm during mating is the guppy (Poecilia reticulata). Here, we examined whether female guppies can obtain information on male fertility (i.e., direct fertility benefits) via cues used during mate choice. Specifically, we examined whether male guppy colour patterns, body size, and mating behaviour signal their functional fertility, that is, their ability to supply a large number of sperm at copulation. We found significant correlations between male phenotype parameters and the number of sperm in male guppies originating from two wild Trinidadian populations. There were, however, significant interpopulation differences with respect to which traits were good predictors of sperm load. In the low-predation Paria River population, larger males and males with relatively more carotenoid colouration had significantly larger sperm loads, but mating behaviour (i.e., sigmoids) and melanin colouration were not good predictors of sperm load. In the high-predation Tacarigua River population, larger males, males that displayed more, and males with less yellow colouration had significantly more sperm, but other colour pattern components (area of orange and black colouration) were not good predictors of sperm load. Overall, our results suggest that there is the potential for direct fertility benefits through mate choice in the promiscuous, non-resource-based mating system of the guppy.",,58,0,,undefined,

In this study, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to investigate inner ear ultrastructure of the Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus), kingfish (Menticirrhus americanus) and spot (Leiostomus xanthurus). These species reflect the diversity of otolith and swim bladder morphology in sciaenids. The distribution of different hair cell bundle types, as well as hair cell orientation patterns on the saccular and lagenar maculae of these fishes were similar to one another. The rostral ends of the saccular sensory epithelia (maculae) were highly expanded in a dorsal-ventral direction in the Atlantic croaker and spotted seatrout as compared to the kingfish and spot. Also, ciliary bundles of the saccular maculae contained more stereocilia in the Atlantic croaker and spotted seatrout as compared with kingfish and spot. The shapes of the lagenar maculae were similar in all four species. In the Atlantic croaker and spotted seatrout lagenar maculae, the number of stereocilia per bundle was greater than those for the kingfish and spot. Given that saccular macula shape and numbers of stereocilia per bundle correlate with swim bladder proximity to the ear in the studied species, it is possible that inner ear ultrastructure could be indicative of auditory ability in fishes.

Analysis of vector strength from global port regions indicates that these NIS, which include amphipods, crustacean zooplankton, mussels and fishes, have been transported principally along dominant shipping routes from native or introduced habitats in northern and western Europe to the Great Lakes. A large group of additional taxa, many of which have extensive invasion histories, is available for transfer to the Great Lakes from key European ports. Thus, joint consideration of invasion corridors and the NIS species established in key donor ports provides an indication of taxa that may colonize the Great Lakes in future. Recent studies indicate that risk assessment may be extended even further for inland lakes subject to NIS invasion from the Great Lakes in cases where invasion vectors can be identified and quantified.

The toxicokinetics of [12C]PCB153 and [13C]PCB 153 were followed in egg and carcass samples with time. Isotopic ratios of PCB153 in yolk lipids were identical to those in carcass lipids after introduction of diet 2, and they did not resemble those of the food at the time of egg formation. The data indicate that the PCB composition of eggs directly reflects the composition of maternal tissues, not the diet, at the time of yolk formation. Egg yolk:carcass lipid concentration ratios for the two isotopes were significantly less than one, averaging 0.33 ± 0.02 (mean ± standard error). Lipid normalized egg:maternal tissue contaminant concentration ratios for persistent organochlorine chemicals in the literature were reviewed for other avian species. The results provide a preliminary data set that suggests egg maternal tissue contaminant concentration ratios vary among species, particularly among species that invest different quantities of lipids to a clutch of eggs.

The calculated unbiased genetic distances were positively correlated with geographical distance within watersheds (P < 0.01; r2 = 0.35) indicating probable genetic equilibrium. Tributary populations in two of the watersheds were not as genetically divergent as would be expected given their large geographical separation. Cross-headwater transfers of fish within relatively recent history are the most likely explanation of this anomaly.

Tone bursts and sinusoidal amplitude modulated sounds were presented to one ear, and recordings were made from the contralateral central nucleus of inferior colliculus (ICC). The receptor specific antagonists, (±)-3-(2-carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid (CPP) for NMDA receptors and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-nitro-2,3-dioxo-benzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide (NBQX) for AMPA receptors, were released at the recording site through a multi-barreled pipette. For most neurons, either CPP or NBQX alone resulted in a reversible reduction in the number of action potentials evoked by tonal stimulation. For neurons with an onset response pattern, NBQX either completely eliminated or greatly reduced the number of action potentials. CPP also reduced the number of action potentials but had a less pronounced effect than NBQX. For neurons with a sustained firing pattern, NBQX reduced the total number of action potentials, but had a preferential effect on the early part (first 10-20 ms) of the response. CPP also resulted in a reduction in the total number of action potentials, but had a more pronounced effect on the later part (>20 ms) of the response. These results indicate that both AMPA and NMDA receptors contribute to sound evoked excitatory responses in the ICC. They have a selective influence on early and late components of tone-evoked responses. Both receptor types are involved in generating excitatory responses across a wide range of sound pressure levels as indicated by rate level functions obtained before and during drug application. In addition, both CPP and NBQX reduced responses to sinusoidal amplitude modulated sounds. The synchrony of firing to the modulation envelope as measured by vector strength at different rates of modulation was not greatly affected by either CPP or NBQX in spite of the decrease in firing rate.",,50,0,,undefined,

C1 neurons are sympathoexcitatory and are involved in both tonic and reflex regulation of sympathetic outflow. This study was designed to determine whether C1 neurons, or their afferents, contain MOR. C1 neurons were identified by using an antibody against the epinephrine synthesizing enzyme phenylethanolamine-N-methyl transferase (PNMT), whereas MOR was localized by using an antipeptide antibody that recognizes the cloned MOR, MOR1. Combined immunoperoxidase and immunogold methods were used to examine the cellular distribution of MOR1 relative to PNMT-containing neurons in the RVL. MOR1 was found in 22% of PNMT-containing dendrites (n = 392), whereas MOR1-containing axons or axon terminals contacted 14% of PNMT-containing dendrites. This distribution was heterogenous with regard to dendritic size: PNMT-labeled dendrites containing MOR1 were usually large (60% were >1.2 μm), whereas PNMT-containing dendrites that received MOR1-labeled afferents were usually small (79% were <1.2 μm). Individual dendrites rarely contained MOR1 at both pre- and postsynaptic sites. Together these results suggest that MOR agonists may directly influence the activity of C1 neurons, as well as the activity of select afferents to these cells. Plasmalemmal membrane labeling for MOR1 was more frequent in smaller PNMT-containing dendrites, suggesting that postsynaptic receptors are more readily available for ligand binding in small dendrites, although the receptor was more frequently detected in larger PNMT dendrites. The selective distribution of MORs to specific pre- and postsynaptic sites suggests the receptor may be selectively trafficked to positions where it may regulate afferent activity that is heterogeneously distributed along the dendritic tree of C1 neurons.",Blood pressure | Rostral ventrolateral medulla | Ultrastructure,19,0,,undefined,

Present as a maternal transcript, the gene is zygotically expressed during gastrulation in a dorsal streak of cells. This streak restricts to a small circular domain underlying the center of presumptive neural plate. Shortly thereafter, a crescent of expression develops at the border of anterior neural ectoderm, and as the central plate domain diminishes, the crescent coalesces to define the presumptive cement gland. Expression remains high throughout cement gland development, and subsequently expands to include ectodermal cells involved in stomodeal invagination. During early organogenesis, expression ensues in developing eye, posterior lateral mesoderm, and first branchial arch derivatives. Ectopic expression of xPitx1 causes head deformities including enlarged cement gland, ectopic cement glands, and posterior deformities or, in extreme cases, inhibition of recognizable structures posterior to the cement gland. Expression of markers such as XCG-1, xOtx2, xPax6, neuralß tubulin, and xTwist suggest that increases in cement gland and lower mandibular size are likely at the expense of other head tissues. Paradoxically, overexpression is sufficient to partially rescue embryos that are axially perturbed by ultraviolet irradiation or retinoic acid administration. Ectopic expression of xPitx1 in ectodermal explants directly promotes cement gland development as there was no evidence that mesodermal or neural tissue was present in explants. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.",Cement gland | Ectopic expression | Head | Induction | Paired-like homeobox | Placode | Retinoic acid | UV | Xenopus laevis,21,0,,undefined,

In addition, A. tumefaciens secretes the Vir proteins, VirE2 and VirF, directly into plant cells via the same VirB/VirD4 transport system [6], and both assist there in the transformation of normal cells into tumor cells. The function of the 22 kDa VirF protein is not clear. Deletion of the virF gene in A. tumefaciens leads to diminished virulence [7, 8] and can be complemented by the expression of the virF gene in the host plant. This finding indicates that VirF functions within the plant cell [8]. Here, we report that the VirF protein is the first prokaryotic protein with an F box by which it can interact with plant homologs of the yeast Skp1 protein. The presence of the F box turned out to be essential for the biological function of VirF. F box proteins and Skp1p are both subunits of a class of E3 ubiquitin ligases referred to as SCF complexes.

We analyzed the relative importance of social mating system and sperm competition to sexual differences in plumage and body size (mass and tail and wing length) of more than 1000 species of birds from throughout the world. In these analyses we controlled for phylogeny and a variety of ecological and life-history variables. We used testis size (corrected for total body mass) as an index of sperm competition in each species, because testis size is correlated with levels of extrapair paternity and is available for a large number of species. In contrast to recent studies, we found strong and consistent effects of social mating system on most forms of dimorphism. Social mating system strongly influenced dimorphism in plumage, body mass, and wing length and had some effect on dimorphism in tail length. Sexual dimorphism was relatively greater in species with polygynous or lekking than monogamous mating systems. This was true when we used both species and phylogenetically independent contrasts for analysis. Relative testis size was also related positively to dimorphism in tail and wing length, but in most analyses it was a poorer predictor of plumage dimorphism than social mating system. There was no association between relative testis size and mass dimorphism. Geographic region and life history were also associated with the four types of dimorphism, although their influence varied between the different types of dimorphism. Although there is much interest in the effects of sperm competition on sexual dimorphism, we suggest that traditional explanations based on social mating systems are better predictors of dimorphism in birds.",Comparative analysis | Extrapair mating | Independent contrasts | Life-history evolution | Sexual selection,245,0,,undefined,

The transcript is present in unfertilized eggs, and it is expressed at higher levels during formation of the antero-posterior dorsal axis in embryos. Although low levels are expressed constitutively except in endodermal cells, adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) expression is dynamically regulated during neurulation. At this stage, expression in ectoderm rapidly diminishes as the neural folds form, and then ANT expression increases slightly in mesoderm. At the culmination of neurulation, the neural tube briefly expresses ANT, and thereafter its expression predominates in the somitic mesoderm and also the chordoneural hinge. In addition, ANT expression is particularly high in the prosencephalon, the mesencephalon, the branchial arches, eye, and the otic vesicle.

SAK and PLK are members of the polo family of serine threonine kinases, which in lower organisms have been shown to be required for the precise regulation of mitosis. Studies of human polo family members have focused on PLK, which has been found to be overexpressed in several tumor types, with the degree of overexpression correlating with adverse clinical outcome. However, PLK expression had not previously been analyzed in colorectal cancer. SAK, a polo family member with unique properties, had not been systematically studied in any tumor type. Methods: In this study, SAK expression was evaluated in a series of sporadic human colorectal cancer specimens (n = 74) and compared with that of PLK. Expression was assessed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Results: In the majority of cases, both SAK and PLK were more highly expressed in tumor tissue than in adjacent normal intestinal mucosa. Levels of SAK and PLK expression in tumor relative to paired normal mucosa correlated directly with patient age and with each other but did not correlate with tumor stage. These results suggest a mechanism for augmented disruption of mitotic regulation in older patients. Conclusions: The polo family mitotic regulators SAK and PLK are both aberrantly expressed in colorectal cancer.

Increased abundance occurred offshore between 1991 (0% of sites) and 1993 (52% of sites at 7/m2). Annual sampling, beginning in 1995, indicates that nymphs increased in both nearshore and offshore waters. By 1997, nymphs were found throughout the lake (88% of sites) at a mean density 40-fold greater (392/m2) than that observed in 1993 (11/m2). In 1998, the distribution of nymphs remained the same as 1997 (88% of sites) but density declined 3-fold (392 to 134/m2). These data indicate that mayflies have recolonized sediments of western Lake Erie and that their abundance may be similar to levels observed before their disappearance in the mid 1950s. However, prior to the mid 1950s, densities were greater in offshore than nearshore waters, but between 1979 and 1998 greater densities occurred near shore than offshore. In addition, there were two areas in the 1990s where low densities consistently occurred. Therefore, recovery of nymphs in western Lake Erie may not have been complete in 1998. At present we do not know the cause for the sudden recolonization of nymphs in large portions of western Lake Erie. Undoubtedly, pollution-abatement programs contributed to improved conditions that would have ultimately led to mayfly recovery in the future. However, the explosive growth of the exotic zebra mussel, Dreissena polymorpha, undoubtedly diverted plankton foods to bottom substrates which could have increased the speed at which Hexagenia spp. nymphs recolonized sediments in western Lake Erie in the 1990s.",Hexagenia | Lake Erie | Mayflies | Recovery,48,0,,LEPF-08-94,Ohio Lake Erie Commission

During recent surveys, P. moitessierianum individuals were found in the St. Clair River delta, Lake St. Clair and western Lake Erie, but were not detected in the Detroit River or western Lake Ontario. Pisidium moitessierianum was collected on sand, silty sand and mud substrata from water depths ranging between 0.6 and 5.4 m. Populations occurred at an average density of 51 ind. m-2 and included juveniles and adults. All individuals were less than 2.0 mm in length. We examined the structure of the umbos and hinge, surface sculpture and shape of the shell, and the anatomy of gills, mantle and nephridia in populations from the lower Great Lakes and Ukrainian inland basins (Dnieper River and Lake Beloye). The results indicated that the Great Lakes' pea clams match European specimens of P. moitessierianum in these conchological and anatomical characteristics. As with other nonindigenous sphaeriids in the Great Lakes, P. moitessierianum was likely introduced through shipping activities into the Great Lakes, possibly as early as the 1890s.",Biological invasion | Bivalve mussel | Cryptogenic species | Great Lakes | Pisidium | Sphaeriidae,10,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

These neurons are likely part of a nonolfactory neural system that innervates the olfactory sac. Cell bodies with 5HT immunoreactivity predominated in the lamina propria of the rostral portion of the nasal cavity and were less prevalent adjacent to the olfactory epithelium. The 5HT-IR fibers were parallel to axons of the olfactory receptor neurons in the lamina propria of the olfactory mucosa and in the olfactory nerve. Serotonergic fibers crossed from the olfactory nerve into the olfactory bulb or branched in the caudal portion of the olfactory nerve and terminated at the junction of the olfactory nerve with the olfactory bulb. In the dorsal olfactory bulb, 5HT-IR fibers coursed along the layer of olfactory fibers. Throughout the layer with glomeruli and mitral cells, 5HT-IR fibers were seen along the border of glomerular units. Experimental lesion of the olfactory nerve was used to determine the origin of 5HT-IR fibers rostral to the olfactory bulb. The loss of these fibers and their reappearance during outgrowth of olfactory receptor neurons inferred that they emanate from the cell bodies in the olfactory sac. The results from this study suggest that axons of olfactory receptor neurons in larval lampreys receive modulation by 5HT from these neuronal fibers.

There are multiple pathways regulating DNA damage-induced apoptosis, and we set out to identify novel mechanisms regulating γ-radiation-induced apoptosis in hematopoietic cells. In this report, we present data implicating the cyclin B1 protein as a regulator of apoptotic fate following DNA damage. Cyclin B1 is the regulatory subunit of the cdc2 serine/threonine kinase, and accumulation of cyclin B1 in late G2 phase of the cell cycle is a prerequisite for mitotic initiation in mammalian cells. We find that abundance of the cyclin B1 protein rapidly increases in several mouse and human hematopoietic cells (Ramos, DP16, HL60, thymocytes) undergoing γ-radiation-induced apoptosis. Cyclin B1 accumulation occurs in all phases of the cell cycle. Antisense inhibition of cyclin B1 accumulation decreases apoptosis, and ectopic cyclin B1 expression is sufficient to induce apoptosis. These observations are consistent with the idea that cyclin B1 is both necessary and sufficient for γ-radiation-induced apoptosis. (C) 2000 by The American Society of Hematology.",,69,0,,undefined,

Larger increases (range 8-19%) in PCB burdens were predicted for benthic feeding sport fish species such as yellow perch and largemouth bass. Small decreases (range 1-5%) in PCB congener concentrations in fish were predicted to result from decreases in bioavailable concentrations of PCBs in water. Bioavailable concentrations of PCBs in water were predicted to decrease as a result of observed changes in POC and DOC concentrations. However, in all cases predicted changes in PCB concentrations in fish, resulting from changes in food web structure and POC and DOC, were smaller than those predicted from measured increases in PCB congener concentrations in sediment between 1993 and 1994 and 1996-1997.

One potentially important constraint for males is the need to provide parental care. Current models of male extrapair mating tactics propose that males reduce extraterritorial foray effort later in the breeding season because they face a trade-off between feeding nestlings versus pursuing extrapair matings. However, detailed field studies examining the trade-off between paternal care and male extraterritorial forays are lacking. We used radiotelemetry to quantify male extraterritorial foray effort in hooded warblers, Wilsonia citrina, to test the widely held predictions that: (1) males make significantly fewer and shorter forays during the nestling stage relative to other stages (i.e. fertile and incubating stages); and (2) male extraterritorial foray effort is negatively correlated with parental effort. Males made 0.87 ± 0.09 forays/h and spent on average 12.2% of their time foraying off territory. Results were equivocal; some data suggested male foray effort decreased in relation to parental care, while other data suggested otherwise. Pairwise tests controlling for (1) extrapair mating opportunity among males and (2) male, territory and social mate quality revealed a possible trade-off between the mean duration and percentage of time in extraterritorial foray versus providing parental care. Conversely, results also revealed (1) no difference in foray rate, foray duration or percentage of time spent off territory over the various stages of the breeding season, (2)no relationship between male foray effort and male feeding rate, and (3) no difference in foray rate in pairwise comparisons, controlling for variability in extrapair mating opportunity and male quality. Overall, the trade-off between providing male parental care and pursuing alternative mating tactics may not be as strong for male hooded warblers as once hypothesized because males dedicated relatively little time to seeking extrapair copulations off territory.

Trends in assimilation kinetics of PCBs in blood were not consistent with the general prediction that solubility limitations of chemicals in the unstirred water layer (UWL) contribute to declines in net AbEs for highly hydrophobic chemicals.

We conducted survey and transplant studies to determine whether colonization and residency on soft sediments by introduced, fouling mussels (Dreissena polymorpha and D. bugensis) were affected by physical disturbance, and whether Dreissena presence in turn influenced the diversity and population densities of other benthic invertebrates. Surveys revealed that colony density was typically higher at moderate depths than at shallower and greater ones. However, the largest, midsummer colonies and greatest coverage of sediments by mussels occurred at deeper sites. 2. Disturbance of transplanted colonies varied by depth and colony size, with deeper and larger colonies experiencing the lowest destruction rates. Colony destruction rate was positively correlated with current velocity adjacent to the lakebed. 3. Absence of mussel colonies at shallow sites was not determined by recruitment or substrate limitation, as recruit density was higher and sediment characteristics more suitable for postveliger settlement at shallow than at deeper sites. Rather, seasonal storms have much stronger effects in shallow than in deep water. 4. Mussel residency on soft sediment has profound effects on invertebrate biodiversity. Invertebrate species (taxon) richness and total abundance were positively correlated with mussel colony area. Mussel-sediment habitat supported between 462 and 703% more taxa, and between 202 and 335% more individuals (exclusive of Dreissena) than adjacent soft-sediment lacking mussels. 5. Results from this study illustrate-that physical disturbance directly limits the distribution of mussels on soft sediments, and the diversity and abundance of other benthic invertebrates in consequence.",Biodiversity | Disturbance ecology | Dreissena | Great Lakes | Mussel beds,92,0,,undefined,

Based on the proportion of edge to core area, males in both habitats avoided the area within 20 m of the edge, implying that males responded to the presence of territory edge rather than forest edge. Surprisingly, however, males in isolated fragments used the edge area significantly more than males in continuous forest, even when measured against the relative amount of edge area within each territory. Elevated levels of edge use were not related to distance of nests to edges, nest stage, or time of day.

Sample extracts were analyzed for concentrations of PAHs, PCBs, and selected organochlorine insecticides (DDT compounds, chlordane compounds, and HCH isomers). Both SPMD and sediment extracts were tested for lethality in an early life-stage mortality assay with Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). The mean concentrations of PCBs, PAHs, and DDT compounds in sediments and SPMDs were highest at three sites in industrialized regions of the Detroit River; at Zug Island near the outflow of the Rouge River, at Elizabeth Park in the Trenton Channel, and at Celeron Island downstream of the Trenton Channel. The mean concentrations of contaminants in sediments and in SPMDs from the various sites were highly correlated, indicating that contaminants in the Detroit River are partitioning between sediments and the dissolved phase of the water column. The lethal concentrations (LC50s) of extracts to early life stages of medaka were highly correlated with the concentrations of PAHs in the samples.

In resident, site-faithful species with continuous partnerships, the better options and the incompatibility hypotheses provide the most likely explanations for divorce. Extrapair mating can be explained by a number of hypotheses often making similar predictions. For example, the good genes and future partnerships hypotheses predict similar patterns if males with good genes also make the best future partners. By considering both divorce and extrapair mating, it may be possible to distinguish between these comparable hypotheses. We examined natural patterns of divorce and extrapair mating in a long-term study of black-capped chickadees (Parus atricapillus). Out of 144 partnerships over 8 years, we observed 11 divorces and 38 faithful pairs between seasons. Females usually divorced between their first and second breeding seasons for males of higher social rank than their previous partners, had similar reproductive success prior to divorce as females who retained their previous partners, and did not divorce on the basis of previous reproductive success. These results confirm earlier experimental evidence that females divorce for better options. Females who divorced were significantly more likely to have had mixed-paternity broods prior to divorce than females who stayed with their previous partners. There was no evidence that females divorced in favour of previous extrapair partners. These results support the good genes hypothesis for extrapair mating, suggesting that female chickadees use divorce and multiple mating as separate strategies sharing a common target.",Better options | Black-capped chickadees | Divorce | Extrapair mating | Good genes,54,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Polychlorinated biphenyl residues in eggs have been associated with reduced reproductive success and embryonic deformities in wild birds. Egg size and composition, specifically the amount of albumen, yolk, and waterin an egg, also influence the growth and viability of embryos and hatchlings, and consequently the reproductive success of birds. To deter mine whether PCB exposure of adult birds affected the size and composition of their eggs, 25 pairs of captive American kestrels (Falco sparverius) were fed a mixture of PCB-spiked (1248:1254:1260) food to give an approximate exposure of 7 mg/kg body weight/d, beginning 1 mo prior to pairing, and continuing throughout the courtship, egg-laying, and incubation periods. This dietary level in the adult female kestrels resulted in mean total PCB residues in the eggs of 34.1 µg/g wet weight (geometric mean), which is environmentally relevant. PCB residues in eggs increased with the time of female exposure to the contaminated diet and laying date. Variation in egg size within PCB clutches was significantly greater than within control clutches, although absolute egg mass and volume did not differ markedly by treatment. Only infertile eggs and only one egg per clutch were used for egg composition analysis. Yolks in the PCB-contaminated eggs were heavier, with less wet and dry albumen relative to control eggs. Water content and eggshell thickness were not significantly affected by PCB exposure. These results suggest that eggs from the PCB treatment have relatively more lipid and less protein available for embryonic development. Changes in egg composition were not associated with egg size, lay date, ambient temperature, humidity, or precipitation, which arefactors known to affect these variables in bird eggs. The PCB-induced changes in egg composition described here provide insight into possible mechanisms contributing to reduced reproductiveperformance in wild birds exposed to PCBs. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,37,0,,undefined,

The olfactory system of the African clawed frog (Xenopus laevis) undergoes dramatic rearrangements during metamorphosis, making this an ideal system in which to examine interactions between the brain and the olfactory sensory epithelium. The main olfactory epithelium of larvae, located in the principal cavity (PC), changes at metamorphosis in function, receptor neuron morphology, biochemistry, and axon termination sites. A new, 'middle', cavity forms during metamorphosis that assumes all the characteristics of the larval PC. Using a combination of bulbectomy and olfactory transplantation, we investigated changes in expression of a marker protein (E7) and in apical ultrastructure in olfactory receptor neurons either (1) connected to the olfactory bulb, (2) connected to non-olfactory brain regions, or (3) with no apparent central nervous system (CNS) connections. We find that neurons in the middle cavity (MC) lacking connections with the CNS appear mature but neurons in the PC do not. Supporting cells in the PC undergo the changes normally observed during metamorphosis. Neurons connected to non-olfactory brain regions, either after bulbectomy or transplantation, appeared normal with regard to the changes normally expected after metamorphosis. These results suggest that influence from the brain is necessary for metamorphic changes in the X. laevis olfactory epithelium, but that these signals are not confined to the olfactory bulb; non-olfactory brain regions can also support these metamorphic changes.",Bulbectomy | Metamorphosis | Olfaction | Transplant | Xenopus laevis,1,0,,37147,

Transgenic constructs were used to provide evidence that UFO regulates floral organ identity by activating or maintaining transcription of the class B organ-identity gene APETALA 3, but not PISTILLATA. In an attempt to understand the biochemical mode of action of the UFO gene product, we show here that UFO is an F-box protein that interacts with Arabidopsis SKP1-like proteins, both in the yeast two-hybrid system and in vitro. In yeast and other organisms both F-box proteins and SKP1 homologues are subunits of specific ubiquitin E3 enzyme complexes that target specific proteins for degradation.

The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) has been attributed with profound changes in invaded ecosystems across eastern North America. We explored vertical profiles of water flow velocity and chlorophyll a concentration in western Lake Erie, over rocky substrates encrusted with Dreissena, to assess the extent to which mussels influence coupling between benthic and pelagic regions of the lake. Flow velocity was always low at surveyed sites (less than or equal to 2.9 cm s-1) and declined in direct proximity to the lakebed. Mean chlorophyll a concentration was also low (less than 5μg L-1) at all sites and depths. Chlorophyll a concentration was positively correlated with distance above lakebed and was lowest (0.3μg L-1) directly adjacent to the lakebed. Spatial patterns of zooplankton grazers could not explain observed vertical gradients in chlorophyll concentration. Hydrodynamic modeling revealed that filtering effects of Dreissena in a nonstratified, shallow basin depend mainly on upstream chlorophyll con- centration, intensity of turbulent diffusion, feeding efficiency of the mussel colony, and the distance downstream from the leading edge of the mussel colony. In contrast to widespread perceptions that molluscs reduce phytoplankton concentration only adjacent to the lakebed, modeling scenarios indicated that depletion occurs throughout the water column. Depletion was, however, inversely proportional to distance above the lakebed. Simulation results are consistent with field-based observations made in shallow water habitats populated by large Dreissena populations in the Great Lakes and elsewhere. Results from this study indicate that zebra mussels strongly enhance coupling between pelagic and benthic regions in shallow lakes. Enhanced coupling between these regions explains, in part, high population densities of Dreissena and of many benthic invertebrates in ecosystems invaded by zebra mussels.",Benthic-pelagic coupling | Exotic species | Great Lakes | Hydrodynamics | Zebra mussel,48,0,,undefined,

The aim of the present study was twofold. Firstly, to determine whether diabetic platelets produce more peroxynitrite than normal platelets and secondly to correlate the peroxynitrite production with the intraplatelet induction of the inducible isoform of nitric oxide-synthase. Methods. Intraplatelet peroxynitrite production was monitored with dichlorofluorescin acetate with a combination of confocal microscopy and steady-state fluorescence. The platelets were probed for the induction of the inducible-nitric oxide-synthase by western immunoblotting. Results. In the presence of extracellular L-arginine (100 μmol/l), platelets from subjects with Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes displayed about 5 times higher fluorescence than those from control subjects. To determine whether inducible-nitric oxide-synthase was the source of peroxynitrite, dichlorofluorescein production was quantified as a function of L-arginine as well as nitric oxide-synthase inhibitors, in platelets from control subjects, subjects with Type I diabetes and subjects with Type II (non-insulin- dependent) diabetes mellitus. Platelets from subjects with Type I yielded about sevenfold and those from Type II about threefold larger amounts of L- arginine/nitric oxide-synthase-dependent dichlorofluorescein fluorescence than those from control subjects. The platelets were then immunologically probed for inducible-nitric oxide-synthase, which has previously been implicated in peroxynitrite production and detected in megakaryocytes of subjects with coronary heart disease. Western immunoblots of intraplatelet proteins indicated that the inducible-nitric oxide-synthase was absent in control subjects. Platelets from both Type I and Type II diabetic subjects, however, contained inducible-nitric oxide-synthase. Conclusion/interpretation.

However, bile FAC data for feral fish populations are typically highly variable, and in a few cases, elevation of FACs has not been observed in fish from contaminated areas. In this study, the bile FACs and hepatic ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activity in brown bullheads (Ameiurus nebulosus) exposed in the laboratory to contaminated sediments from Hamilton Harbour, Ontario, Canada, increased by 173-fold within 72 h of initial exposure and rapidly declined thereafter. In bullheads caged in the contaminated Trenton Channel area of the Detroit River, bile FACs also increased rapidly within 4 d of initial exposure to mean levels >3,000 ng of benzo[a]pyrene equivalents per milliliter of bile. Surprisingly, there was no difference in the mean-levels of bile FACs in fish caged above the sediment versus fish caged in direct contact with the sediment, indicating that water may be the major vector for uptake of PAHs. The lower bile FACs in bullheads caged in other regions of the Detroit River were consistent with the lower concentrations of PAHs in the sediments from these areas. These data indicate that bile FAC levels are a biomarker of recent exposure to aromatic hydrocarbons in sediments. However, FAC data were highly variable even in these studies, in which fish were relatively homogeneous in size, feeding status, and exposure history. Therefore, even higher variability in bile FAC data are expected in biomarker studies as a result of differences in reproductive status, size, diet, and mobility of the fish.",Bile fluorescent aromatic compounds | Biomarker | Bullheads | Detroit River,39,0,,undefined,

We performed single unit recordings and investigated the unit's free-field frequency tuning, and/or the unit's response to the interaural level differences (under dichotic stimulation), before and during local applications of antagonists specific to gamma-aminobutyric acid A and glycine receptors. Our results showed that application of bicuculline produced a broadening of free-field frequency tuning, and differential changes in free-field frequency tuning depending on sound direction, i.e., more pronounced at azimuths at which the unit exhibited narrower frequency tuning under the pre-drug condition, thereby typically abolishing direction dependence in tuning. Application of strychnine produced no change in frequency tuning. The results from dichotic stimulation further revealed that bicuculline typically elevated and/or flattened the unit's interaural-level-difference response function, indicating a reduction in the strength of binaural inhibition.

Knowledge of the mechanism by which contaminants are absorbed and biomagnified in food chains is important in environmental risk assessment and studies of chemical bioavailability. In this study, we hypothesize a fugacity based model of the gastrointestinal absorption of contaminants. We test the model in a 73 day laboratory, gastrointestinal magnification study of 2,2',4,4',6,6'-hexachlorobiphenyl in adult rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and in a field study of the gastrointestinal magnification of PCB congeners in rock bass (Ambloplites rupestris). Both studies show that the fugacity of the test chemicals in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) can increase to levels up to 7-8-fold greater than those in the consumed food. The fugacity increase in the GIT is the result of a drop in the chyme's fugacity capacity for the test chemicals (i.e. approximately 4- fold in this study) and an increase in chemical concentration due to food absorption in the GIT (i.e. approximately 2-fold in this study). Food digestibility and absorption are found to be critical factors controlling biomagnification factors and dietary uptake efficiencies under laboratory and field conditions.",,202,0,,undefined,

Two hindcasting scenarios were compared to a third, previously verified, scenario to determine the changes in PCB congener concentrations in biota in response to (i) modifications to food web structure, before and after the introduction of mussels. and (ii) modifications to food web structure combined with a decline in particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations resulting from removal of seston from the water column by mussel filtering activities. The reduction in the concentration of POC, attributed to the prodigious filter-feeding of large zebra mussel populations, was predicted to have caused increases in the freely dissolved concentrations of PCB congeners ranging from 2.9% to 9.3%. These increases in dissolved chemical were predicted by the model to cause small increases (range 0-7.3%) in the PCB congener burdens of many biota including zooplankton, prey fish species, and walleye. Other organisms, such as Gammarus, small white suckers, and freshwater drum, were predicted to have larger increases in their PCB body burdens (9.1-22.2%) as a result of the increase in freely dissolved chemical and a shift in diet. For crayfish, yellow perch, black crappie, white perch, large white suckers, gizzard shad, and largemouth bass, the increased exposure to chemical via water was offset by decreased chemical exposure via the diet, which resulted from shifts in diet toward less contaminated items brought about by the presense of zebra mussels.

Tenascin-C, a glycoprotein of the extracellular matrix, is localized along developing axonal pathways where it may function by repulsion, restricting axons within specific boundaries. The lamprey olfactory pathway offers an advantageous model for studying the role of extracellular matrix proteins in axon guidance because the entire pathway is readily seen in horizontal sections and because lesioning the olfactory nerve will induce the system into a new phase of coordinated neurogenesis and axon outgrowth. Although tenascin-C expression was absent during embryonic development, olfactory nerve fascicles contained tenascin-C-immunoreactivity (IR) during the larval stage. During retrograde degeneration, the fascicles lost tenascin-C-IR. Diffuse unfasciculated axonal processes extending from the olfactory epithelium did not express tenascin-C-IR; however, acetylated tubulin and GAP-43-IR was present, indicating axonal outgrowth. When the newly extended axons of olfactory receptor neurons converged to form fascicles, tenascin-C-IR was evident within the fascicular boundaries.

Although the C-terminal domain of ICK1 contained an important consensus sequence with the mammalian CDK inhibitor p27(Kip1), the remainder of the deduced ICK1 sequence showed little similarity to any known CDK inhibitors. In vitro assays showed that recombinant ICK1 exhibited unique kinase inhibitory properties. In the present study we characterized ICK1 in terms of its gene structure, its interaction with both A. thaliana Cdc2a and CycD3, and its induction by the plant growth regulator, abscisic acid (ABA). ICK1 was expressed at a relatively low level in the tissues surveyed. However, ICK1 was induced by ABA, and along with ICK1 induction there was a decrease in Cdc2-like histone H1 kinase activity. These results suggest a molecular mechanism by which plant cell division might be inhibited by ABA. ICK1 clones were also identified from independent yeast two-hybrid screens using the CycD3 construct. The implication that ICK1 protein could interact with both Cdc2a and CycD3 was confirmed by in vitro binding assays.

Differences in habitats occupied by these species allowed the testing of hypotheses relating timing of sensory ontogeny to habitat shifts in fish larvae. Migration of menhaden from offshore to estuarine waters coincided with, or was preceded by, auditory bulla inflation, development of rod photoreceptors, onset of retinal summation, improvements in visual acuity, and formation of cephalic lateral-line canals. Examination of developmental patterns in sardine and anchovy larvae, both of which live inshore throughout the larval period, showed that some of these associations between habitat and sensory morphology were adaptive and some coincidental. Inflation of the auditory bullae occurred earlier in the larval period in anchovy than in menhaden. Specializations for enhanced visual sensitivity occurred earliest in anchovy but were not different between sardine and menhaden. There was no correspondence between habitat and visual acuity or lateral-line development. Thus, ontogeny of auditory bulla inflation and retinal sensitivity may coincide with habitat shifts, at least at the family level, but lateral-line development is more constrained by phylogeny than adapted to ecology.",,31,0,,undefined,

Water in these habitats contains abundant dissolved organic material (DOM). Amorphous material commonly found on black fly labral fans was formerly but erroneously thought to be an endogenously produced glycoconjugate that aided particle capture. We hypothesized that architecture of the labral fans may cause in situ flocculation of DOM, which is then directly ingested. Half-grown Simulium vittatum Zetterstedt and S. piperi Dyer and Shannon larvae were held for 84 h in stir-bar-driven rearing chambers containing filtered water with or without 3.0 mg/L brewer's yeast and with or without 20.0 mg/L DOM (an aqueous extract of moss). Water was partially replaced every 6 h. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to examine particulate material from test water collected on membrane filters and to study labral fans of selected larvae from parallel experiments. Other larvae were longitudinally sectioned and stained with Alcian Blue, which detects glycoconjugates. Concentrations of DOM (determined by ultraviolet spectroscopy) and fine particulate organic matter (measured by filtration) in chambers did not change over 84 h. Larvae in control and DOM-only trials displayed aggregative behavior typical of severely food-limited simuliids, whereas larvae in yeast-supplemented trials were haphazardly arranged. Control larvae exhibited little or no growth (increase in mean body length). Larvae in both DOM and yeast-supplemented treatments grew significantly more than control larvae, achieving growth rates of 4.0-17.0%/ d (DOM-only), 11.3-14.8%/d (yeast-only), or more. Guts of larvae from all treatments stained positively, indicating that they contained glycoconjugates. Filters and labral fans examined by SEM contained yeast cells but not bacterial cells. However, labral fans also lacked evidence of adhering glycoconjugates. Small quantities of amorphous material consistent with flocculated DOM were observed on filters. Simuliid larvae can grow in a medium containing only allochthonously derived DOM. Although evidence is inconclusive, we speculate that DOM is precipitated on labral fans and ingested. Under natural conditions, DOM may be a direct and significant food source for simuliid larvae.",Dissolved organic matter | Feeding | Glycoconjugate | Growth | Humic | Polysaccharide | Simuliidae,35,0,,undefined,

To investigate the differential size between jacks and immature fish, chinook salmon were tagged and reared in seawater for 5 months prior to sexual maturation (March-August). During this time, immature males, females, and jacks were sampled monthly for wet weight and plasma concentrations of triiodo-L-thyronine (T3), testosterone, and growth hormone (GH). Fish were also sampled in the preceding December as controls. The weight-frequency distribution of the sampled fish became significantly bimodal in May, with the upper modal group consisting mostly of jacks. Jacks had the highest relative growth (RG) rates from April-June. Jacks had significantly elevated plasma T3 concentration in March only, and had significantly elevated testosterone levels throughout the experiment. There were no significant differences in plasma GH concentrations between jacks and immature fish; however, in jacks, plasma GH concentrations were positively correlated with RG during April-May, and plasma testosterone levels were positively correlated with RG for June-August. Although a number of hormonal differences between jacks and immature fish coincided with the differential growth rates, no measured hormone concentration could explain the observed differences in growth and size.",Differential growth | Growth hormone | Jack salmon | Testosterone | Thyroid hormone,13,0,,undefined,

These, in turn, may be inactivated by binding directly onto glutathione (GSH) or by enzymatic conjugation with glutathione S-transferase (GST). In this study, we have investigated GSH and GST during retrograde degeneration and regeneration of the olfactory nerve in rainbow trout. In these fish, prolonged ORN physiological activity and structural integrity following transection of the olfactory nerve may be mediated by GSH and GST. In the olfactory mucosa, early changes following nerve lesion and prior to ORN degeneration included a shift of intense GSH labeling from the dendrites and perikarya of a subpopulation of ORN, and from melanophores, to olfactory nerve fascicles. GSH levels were unchanged, but GST activity decreased by 33% and GST-immunoreactivity (GST-IR) in nerve fascicles diminished slightly. When the process of massive degeneration terminated and ORN were largely absent, GSH levels and GST activity decreased further, GSH labeling was confined to melanophores, and GST-IR was absent. As ORN repopulated the olfactory mucosa, GST-IR was widespread. The combination of increased GST activity (92% of preoperative values) and low GSH levels suggests GSH utilization for GST conjugation reactions. These changes imply that GSH provides protection from cellular debris associated with ORN degeneration. Recovery of GST activity and widespread GST-IR during regeneration indicates modulation of neuroprotective, developmental, and/or physiological processes by GST.",,13,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Invasions of terrestrial ecosystems dominated (>97%) the surveyed literature. Disturbance was associated with establishment of exotic species in 56% of these studies, though its importance differed among papers describing plants (68%) and animals (28%). Plants species (86%) were significantly more dependent on disturbance for establishment than were animals (12%). However, animals and plants that were dependent on disturbance for establishment were almost equally dependent (58 versus 68%) on it for range expansion. In a second survey, 402 plant and 103 animal taxa were identified that explicitly linked establishment of exotic species to disturbance. Human activities were attributed with establishment of species in 97 and 57% of these cases, respectively. Common mechanisms associated with establishment of exotic animals included ballast water discharge, intentional releases, and residential development. Establishment of exotic plants was associated with animal activities (e.g., grazing, seed introduction), soil disturbance, forestry, fire, agriculture, and human activities. In contrast to invasions theory, our survey indicates that the association between establishment and spread of exotic species and disturbance ought not be assumed a priori. Some animals repeatedly invade new habitats once geographic barriers are circumvented, indicating that communities may be more receptive to exotic species than previously acknowledged.

During metamorphosis, the larval organ transforms into a prominent lamellar structure with large distinct olfactory epithelial cells that is characteristic of the adult lamprey. In the present study, scanning electron microscopy and light microscopy are used to examine changes during the seven stages (1-7) of metamorphosis. The magnitude of growth over the course of metamorphosis is evident from the doubling of the relative weight of the nasal sac. During early metamorphosis (stages 1 and 2), the larval olfactory organ enlarges, and by stage 3 specific adult structures begin to form, namely a nasal valve between the nasal tube and the organ, lameIlar folds, and diverticuli of the accessory olfactory organ. Subsequent development involves widening of the cells lining the lamellar folds to the form characteristic of postmetamorphic lampreys. Although the cells in the troughs initially retain numerical density values that are significantly higher than those on the lamellar surfaces, by stage 7 values decline both in troughs and along lamellar surfaces to those observed in adults. These results show that although expansion of the olfactory organ is ongoing throughout metamorphosis, remodeling occurs early (by stage 3).

In these flies, Bic-D activity can be induced early in oogenesis, allowing an oocyte to be made. Then, by shifting females to non-inducing conditions, Bic-D levels are depleted for the remainder of oogenesis. Using this system, we find that Bic-D is indeed required in the later stages of oogenesis. In ovaries from mutant females, oocyte growth is reduced, apparently due to defects in nurse-cell-to-oocyte transport. Smaller oocyte size results in the misalignment of follicle cells and the underlying germ line, leading to ventralization of dorsal follicle cells and to defects in centripetal cell migration. In addition, we show that Bic-D is required for the localization of specific mRNAs at both the anterior and posterior of the oocyte.",Axis formation | Bicaudal-D (Bic-D) | Cytoskeleton | Drosophila | Egg chamber | Follicle cell | Nurse cell | Oogenesis | RNA localization,66,0,,undefined,

Menhaden larvae showed a decrease in cone photoreceptor density and first developed rod photoreceptors when their total length (TL) reached 8-10 mm; they began summing photoreceptive inputs at 12-14 mm TL. Inflation of the auditory bullae was complete by 15 mm TL. The proliferation of superficial neuromasts varied depending on their location, with cephalic superficial neuromasts decreasing in number beginning at 19 mm TL and numbers of trunk neuromasts continuing to increase throughout the larval period. In behavioral trials, responsiveness and the reactive distance to the approaching probe increased with increasing larva total length when all sensory inputs were available (control larvae). When visual inputs were blocked, responsiveness was lower than in control larvae, but still increased ontogenetically, while reactive distance showed no difference between control larvae and those lacking visual information. When neuromasts were ablated, ontogenetic increases in responsiveness and reactive distance were absent. Inflation of the auditory bullae had no discernible effect on behavior.

By several genetic criteria, we show a functional interaction between CDC28 and PKC1 with PKC1 apparently functioning with respect to bud emergence downstream of START. Consistent with this, activity of the MAP kinase homolog Mpk1 (a putative Pkc1 effector) is stimulated by activation of Cdc28. Furthermore, we demonstrate a cell cycle-dependent hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholine to diacylglycerol (a PKC activator) and choline phosphate at START. Diacylglycerol production is stimulated by Cdc28 in cycling cells and is closely associated with Cdc28 activation at START. These results imply that the activation of Pkc1, which is known to be necessary during bud morphogenesis, is mediated via the CDC28-dependent stimulation of PC-PLC activity in a novel cell cycle-regulated signaling pathway.",Cdc28 | Cell cycle | Phosphatidylcholine | Protein kinase C | Saccharomyces cerevisiae,65,0,,undefined,

Previous studies suggest that the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of CAP have distinct functions. We have explored the interactions of human CAP with various proteins. First, by performing yeast two-hybrid screens, we have identified peptides from several proteins that interact with the C-terminal and/or the N-terminal domains of human CAP. These peptides include regions derived from CAP and BAT3, a protein with unknown function. We have further shown that MBP fusions with these peptides can associate in vitro with the N-terminal or C-terminal domains of CAP fused to GST. Our observations indicate that CAP contains regions in both the N- terminal and C-terminal domains that are capable of interacting with each other or with themselves. Furthermore, we found that myc-epitope-tagged CAP coimmunoprecipitates with HA-epitope-tagged CAP from either yeast or mammalian cell extracts. Similar results demonstrate that human CAP can also interact with human CAP2. We also show that human CAP interacts with actin, both by the yeast two-hybrid test and by coimmunoprecipitation of epitope- tagged CAP from yeast or mammalian cell extracts. This interaction requires the C-terminal domain of CAP, but not the N-terminal domain. Thus CAP appears to be capable of interacting in vivo with other CAP molecules, CAP2, and actin.

Ten rocks were collected from quadrats at six sites along each of three transect lines oriented perpendicular to shore. Occurrence, abundance and biomass of Dreissena on smaller, movable rocks were positively associated with rock distance from shore (∼lake depth) and with rock area; rocks at nearshore sites supported little, if any, Dreissena, whereas those at offshore sites were heavily colonized. Mussel size distributions also differed in relation to shore distance. Large mussels (≥19 mm) were underrepresented or absent on rocks collected at nearshore sites, but were overrepresented at offshore locations (≥37 m). Settlement of larval mussels on settling pads was positively correlated with distance offshore and with time of exposure, though settlement was substantial even at a nearshore (10 m) location. Area-adjusted mussel dry mass increased more rapidly with distance offshore on large than on small rocks. Large rocks also required more force to displace and were significantly less likely to be disturbed when transplanted at the study site. Results from this study indicate that occurrence, abundance and size structure of Dreissena in nearshore waters of Lake Erie correspond with the frequency of habitat disturbance, though other factors including food limitation and larval supply may also contribute to these patterns.

If the limiting prey constitute a trophic level (i.e. zooplankton, benthos, or fish), we define the phenomenon as a trophic bottleneck. Growth of a non-stunted population of yellow perch, Perca flavescens, was simulated using an allocation model based on reported ontogenetic shifts in diet (planktivory to benthivory to piscivory). The model was then perturbed by limiting the available ration individually for each of the three feeding types. The resulting simulated growth curves all reflected lower growth rates than the unperturbed state and the shape of the curve differed between the limited food types. Only the reduced benthic ration produced a simulated growth that matched that observed for the stunted yellow perch of Lac Hertel (Québec). To test the hypothesis that benthic ration was limiting growth in Lac Hertel, all the fish species in the lake were sampled for diet composition and total length at age. We predicted that species feeding upon benthic invertebrates should exhibit the slow growth characteristic of stunting (based on the results of the allocation model). Of the seven fish species found in Lac Hertel, four were stunted: yellow perch, pump-kinseed, Lepomis gibbosus, rock bass, Ambloplites rupestris, and brown bullhead, Ictalurus nebulosus. Three species were non-stunted: northern pike, Esox lucius, golden shiner, Notemigonus crysoleucas, and white sucker, Catostomus commersoni. All stunted species fed on benthic invertebrates and all non-stunted species, except the white sucker, did not feed upon benthos. The prediction of the allocation model was thus supported. © 1996 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",Benthic prey | Computer simulation | Diet | Fish | Ration limitation,40,0,,undefined,

Light traps were located at the shore and at increasing distances inland up to 5 km, and were operated simultaneously for 2 h following sunset. Catches of five species of caddisflies of the family Hydropsychidae (Cheumatopsyche campyla, Cheumatopsyche speciosa, Hydropsyche hageni, Hydropsyche phalerata, Macrostemum zebratum) and the mayfly Hexagenia (Ephemeridae) were used to examine inland distribution. 2. Inland dispersal was limited: catches of caddisflies declined at a greater than exponential rate with increasing distance from shore. Mean dispersal distance from the shoreline ranged from 650 to 1845 m. Smaller caddisfly species dispersed shorter distances than larger caddisflies and Hexagenia. 3. Inland distribution of adult caddisflies exhibited considerable interspecific variation: distribution was inconsistent among trials for Hexagenia, possibly owing to timing of collections in relation to periods of peak emergence. 4. Sex ratios of caddisflies were female biased at most sites. No consistent bias was observed for Hexagenia. Different inland distribution patterns were observed for males and females. The differences appeared to reflect species-specific reproductive strategies.",,103,0,,undefined,

The quinone-reductive characteristics of these two cell lines were examined using an acetylated cytochrome c reduction assay for enzymatic reductase activity. Subsequently, the influence of DT diaphorase on the genotoxicity of two model quinones, menadione (MND) and 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (PQ) was examined in an alkaline unwinding assay for DNA single-strand breaks. Results revealed that DT diaphorase was the predominant quinone reductase in cytosols of both cell lines, and that levels of specific DT diaphorase activity were generally equivalent in the two species. Despite these similarities, results revealed marked qualitative differences between the two species in terms of the influence of DT diaphorase on quinone-mediated genotoxicity. When pretreated with the DT diaphorase inhibitor, dicoumarol, HepG2 cells exhibited a marked exacerbation of genotoxicity in the presence of either MND or PQ, indicating a protective influence of the enzyme. In contrast, quinone genotoxicity in BB cells was not affected by DT diaphorase inhibition, indicating the lack of a protective effect of DT diaphorase.

Nymphs were absent from the sediments of most of western Lake Erie after the 1950s, although small, widely disjunct populations apparently persisted near shore. Sediment samples collected in 1993 revealed several small populations near the western and southern shores and beyond the mouths of the Detroit and Maumee rivers. A larger population was found in the southern island area, but nymphs were absent in the middle of the basin. By 1995, nymphs had spread throughout the western half and eastern end of the basin but remained absent from the middle of the basin. These data indicate that Hexagenia began recolonizing nearshore areas before offshore areas. Increasingly large swarms of winged Hexagenia on shore and over the lake between 1992 and 1994 further indicate that mayflies are recolonizing the basin. Factors that have permitted Hexagenia recovery in western Lake Erie probably include improved sediment and water quality attributed to pollution abatement programs implemented after the early 1970s, and perhaps environmental changes in the early 1990s attributed to effects of the exotic' zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha).",Biomonitoring | Lake Erie | mayfly | water quality,80,0,,undefined,

At that stage, Baby Lake had a pH of 4.0-4.2 while the adjacent Alice Lake had a pH 5.9-6.3. Both lakes were almost entirely devoid of algae and had neither Zooplankton nor fish. Soon after the closure of the smelter, with its large airborne volume of sulphur dioxide and of copper and nickel containing particulates, the chemistry of the lakes began to change. By 1985, Baby Lake had changed from pH 4.0 to 6.8 and is now at pH 7.2. The pH of Alice Lake increased from a low of 5.9 in the early 1970s to 6.9-7.4 in the mid 1980s and is now at 7.3. Copper and nickel concentrations also decreased in both lakes during this period. The first biota found in the lakes in the post-smelter stage in the early 1980s were benthic red chironomids, planktonic rotifers, and a limited number of phytoplankton species, of which Rhizosolenia was the most common. By the 1990s, 13 phytoplankton species were present in each lake, with a substantial Zooplankton fauna (14 species) of rotifers, copepods, and cladocerans. There are now numerous insect larvae in the sediment and some small fish in both lakes.

We have used immunocytochemical methods to determine the localization and potential role of the cysteine protease in development of young larvae. In prenauplius larvae, there is intense staining for the protease on the basal side of the epidermal layer in the posterior region and diffuse staining for the protease throughout the embryo. In first instar larvae, cysteine-protease staining becomes intense in the midgut-forming area where a reticulum-like pattern emerges in cells with an abundance of yolk platelets. Cysteine-protease staining in second instar larvae becomes intense in the apical side of epidermal cells and in the basal and apical zones of midgut cells. Subcellular localization of the protease in the epidermis and midgut of young larvae using immunogold electron microscopy suggests that most is located in the cytosol and extracellular matrix adiacent to these cells. Addition of cysteine-protease inhibitors to the growth medium, especially the fluoromethyl ketone Z-Phe-Ala-CH2F, inhibits growth and segmentation of the thorax. Collectively, these observations suggest that the major cysteine protease in embryos and larvae functions in yolk utilization, as a hatching enzyme, in apolysis during the molt cycle, and as a digestive enzyme when the swimming larvae begin to feed. © 1995 Springer-Verlag.",Artemia franciscana (Crustacea) | Cysteine protease | Development,19,0,,undefined,

The genes are envisaged as defining discrete spatial domains and, subsequently, conferring specific segmental identities on cells undergoing differentiation along the antero‐posterior axis. However, several aspects of the observed mutant phenotypes are inconsistent with this view. These include: the appearance of other, unexpected transformations along the dorsal axis; the occurrence of mirror‐image duplications; and the development of anomalies outside the established domains of normal Hox gene expression. In this paper, Hox gene disruptions are shown to elicit regeneration‐like responses in tissues confronted with discontinuities in axial identity. The polarities and orientations of transformed segments which emerge as a consequence of this response obey the rules of distal transformation and intercalary regeneration. In addition, the incidence of periodic anomalies suggests that the initial steps of Hox‐mediated patterning occurs in Hensen's node. As gastrulation proceeds, mesoderm cell cycle kinetics impose constraints upon subsequent cellular differentiation. This results in the delayed manifestation of transformations along the antero‐posterior axis. Finally, a paradigm is sketched in which temporal, rather than spatial axial determinants direct differentiation. Specific, testable predictions are made about the role of Hox genes in the establishment of segmental identity. Copyright © 1995 Cambridge University Press",,12,0,,undefined,

The availability of large quantities of monospecific antibody has provided research scientists with a variety of diagnostic, biochemical, and molecular tools with which to address their particular biological problems. The process of recovering phage displaying a recombinant antibody by biological panning entails the indirect immobilization of phage to a solid surface or recoverable particle via an antibody–antigen interaction. In one such approach, the antigen is immobilized to a solid surface such as polystyrene petri dishes or Immunotubes (Nunc). In another approach, the antigen is biotinylated and presented to the phage library in solution, followed by recovery of the antigen–antibody complex using streptavidin-coated paramagnetic beads. The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in the understanding of the molecular genetic bases of antibody expression in mammalian systems. In particular, the application of recombinant DNA techniques has made possible the precise manipulation of those genetic segments encoding the vast combinatorial repertoire of antibody structures that are characteristic of the animal immune response. Corresponding advances have been made in the understanding of the structure of immunoglobin gene family hierarchies, particularly from murine and human sources. © 1995, Academic Press, Inc.",,2,0,,undefined,

The two isoforms appear to serve as early markers for the presumptive neural axis; however, their expression patterns differ. RARγ2, 1 is first expressed at gastrulation at the dorsal lip and subsequently along the presumptive neural axis. RARγ2.2 represents the full‐length sequence of a receptor cDNA already partially characterized and present as a maternal transcript [Ellinger‐Ziegelbauer and Dreyer (1991); Genes Dev 5:94‐104, (1993): Mech Dev 41:31‐46; Pfeffer and DeRobertis, (1994) Mech Dev: 45:147‐153]. Unlike RARγ2.2, the 2.1 variant is not expressed either in pre‐somitic mesoderm or notochord. RARγ2.1 is strongly expressed in branchial arches and to a lesser extent in the neural floor plate. The two isoforms also exhibit differential sensitivity to retinoic acid. Constitutive expression of RARγ2.2 following neurulation appears to be depressed by treatment with retinoic acid, but domains of highest expression, namely, the head and tail, remain relatively unaffected, as do patterns of expression prior to late neurulation. By contrast, RARγ2.1 is not transcribed in retinoid‐inhibited structures. Using microinjection techniques, we show that changes of RARγ2.1 expression in presumptive head structures occur as an early and local consequence of retinoic acid administration. Since RARγ2.1 expression is inhibited by retinoic acid, we tested to see if other treatments that perturb axis formation had any effect. Surprisingly, UV irradiation did not suppress expression of the RARγ2.1 transcript, suggesting that its inhibition by retinoic acid is not due solely to inhibition of anterior neural development. These experiments demonstrate a new subdivision of isoforms that undergo differential expression during development and that exhibit differential sensitivity to retinoic acid and to UV. This sensitivity and the presence of this isoform variant in regions that are known to exhibit polarizing activity strengthen the hypothesis that these receptors play a primary role during morphogenesis.

Our results show a dramatic difference in the pattern of expression of these two genes. Consistent with previous reports, we detected CAP/MCH1 mRNA in all tissues examined; however, levels vary substantially between tissues. In particular, we found that CAP/MCHI mRNA are present at relatively high levels in spleen, testes and lung, at moderate levels in brain, kidney, liver and small intestine, and at significantly lower levels in heart, skeletal muscle and skin. We have also investigated the levels of CAP/MCH1 in rat tissues by immunoblotting with a polyclonal antibody raised against a human CAP::GST fusion protein. In general, we find that the CAP/MCH1 mRNA levels reflect the amount of CAP/MCH1 found in different tissues.

The possibility that such an engine may help to reduce exhaust emissions substantially by taking advantage of natural gas fuel properties, such as its antiknock properties and extended lean flammability limit compared to gasoline, was the main motivation behind the investigation. A four cylinder, automotive type spark ignition engine was used in the investigation. The engine was converted to operate on natural gas by replacing its fuel system with a gaseous carburetion system. A 3-way metal metrix catalytic converter was used in the engine exhaust system to reduce emission levels. The engine operated satisfactorily at an equivalence ratio as lean as 0.6, at all speeds and loads. As a result NOx emissions were significantly reduced. However, hydrocarbon emissions were high, particularly at very lean conditions and light loads. Most of these hydrocarbons were made up of methane with small concentrations of ethane and propane. Coefficient of variations in hydrocarbons were generally high at very lean operating conditions and light loads, but decreased with increasing equivalence ratio and engine speed. Methane concentrations in the engine exhaust decreased with increasing load and equivalence ratio. At lean air-to-fuel ratios and light loads oxidation of methane in the catalyst was substantially limited and no NOx reduction was achieved. In addition, the proportion of nitric oxide in oxides of nitrogen increased with increasing amount of NOx in the engine exhaust. A major problem encountered in the study was the inability of the fuel system to maintain near constant air-to-fuel ratios at steady operating conditions. © Copyright 1995 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,14,0,,undefined,

To test for genetic differentiation between nine populations of chinook salmon, Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, from south‐western British Columbia, Canada, DNA was extracted from 603 fish and hybridized with a single‐locus minisatellite probe. Multivariate statistical analyses of the resulting allele size data permitted successful overall population identification of 52% (individual population range: 24–78%; P < 0.005), indicating a high level of genetic differentiation among the nine populations. Two of the nine populations were further analysed using data from a second minisatellite locus. The discrimination success rate improved from 81.1% (one‐locus analyses) to 90.0% (two‐locus analyses), indicating the potential for greatly increased resolution gained by the addition of more loci. These results indicate that variation at minisatellite loci can be used for assessing population‐level genetic structure, even with artificial gene flow. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

The zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) is amongst the most recent species to invade the Great Lakes. We explored the suppressive capabilities of mussels 6–22‐mm in size on Lake St Clair microzooplankton (< 240)μm) in laboratory experiments. 2. Absolute suppression of rotifers and Dreissena veliger larvae was proportional to mussel shell length for individuals larger than 10 mm; larger zooplankton, mainly copepod nauplii and Cladocera, were not affected. Mussel clearance rates on rotifers generally exceeded those on veligers, although rates for both increased with increasing mussel size. Rotifer‐based clearance rates of large (22 mm) mussels approached published values for phytoplankton food. 3. Most zooplankton taxa, particularly rotifers, declined significantly in western Lake Erie during the late 1980s concomitant with the establishment and population growth of zebra mussels in the basin. Densities of some taxa subsequently increased, although rotifers and copepod nauplii densities remained suppressed through 1993. Available evidence indicates that direct suppression by Dreissena coupled with food limitation provides the most parsimonious explanation for these patterns. Copyright © 1995, Wiley Blackwell.

Synthetic UAS elements containing individual motifs, or combinations of them, were inserted in place of the natural UAS, and assayed using a lacZ reporter gene. The REB1 binding sites were found to be essential for, and sufficient to restore partial, UAS activity. AT-rich tracts alone were inactive. Multimerization of a REB1 binding site created a UAS that in galactose is more active, but in glucose less active, than a UAS having a single REB1 site with one AT-rich tract. In general, transcription during growth in galactose or glycerol/lactate responds more to multimerization of motifs. The results suggest that the natural actin promoter UAS retains activity on these alternative carbon sources because of reiteration of sequence elements within it; the additional elements appear to be redundant when cells are grown on glucose. The MluI site, which is present upstream of a number of yeast genes involved in DNA synthesis and confers cell cycle periodicity to those genes, contributes to the activity of the synthetic UAS elements, but not in a cell-cycle-dependent manner.",,15,0,,undefined,

The Canadian Council of Ministers of the Environment (CCME) has established science-based protocols for developing national environmental quality guidelines (numerical concentration limits) for contaminants in water, sediment, tissue, and soil (for soils the term ""criteria"" is used instead of guidelines). These published protocols nol only allow for the use of standardized approaches to derive guidelines, but also facilitate the meaningful synthesis and critique of the available scientific data for specific contaminants. Many data gaps concerning fate, exposure and effects of contaminants exist (e.g. factors affecting specialion and biouvuilubility of metals in the environment). However, these protocols allow for guideline development while identifying the priority recommendations for research and monitoring. The primary goal of these guidelines is to protect designated uses of environmental media (e.g. water for irrigation) or directly protect organisms from specific contaminants. Canadian environmental quality guidelines are developed to provide basic scientific information about the effects of water quality variables on water uses. This information can then be used to establish environmental quality objectives at specific sites. Environmental quality objectives are derived in the same way as guidelines, except the only species and environmental conditions relevant to the specific site are considered. The objectives may then be used as benchmarks for the assessment of environmental quality at the specific site. The derivation of guidelines for cadmium was based upon currently available information concerning environmental fate, behaviour and toxicity of cadmium (Cd). For example, a draft guideline of 0.017 μg Cd·-L-1 for the protection of freshwater life was derived incorporating the influence of hardness on metal toxicity. © 1995.",,7,0,,undefined,

Inhibited development of anterior structures was far greater on the injected side of the embryo than on the uninjected side.

Both species and size classes experienced high survival rates in western (>95%) and eastern (> 85%) Lake Erie. Length-and mass-specific growth rates varied significantly between locations and mussel size classes, but not by species. Mussels incubated in the warm, western basin of Lake Erie exibited growth {length and mass), whereas those in the cooler eastern basin did not.

Large mussels of both species experienced no mortality, whereas small quagga mussels experienced a significantly higher rate of mortality (50%) at the higher temperature than did small zebra mussels (10%).

Whole-mount in situ hybridization and Northern blot analysis indicates that troponin Ic is first expressed in tailbud embryos (stage 28) about the time of the first cytological heart differentiation and about 24 hr before beating tissue is observed. We have used this marker to examine abnormal heart morphogenesis in embryos treated with retinoic acid and lithium. When retinoic acid is administered to embryos prior to heart specification, heart tissue is reduced and often completely ablated. When embryos are treated after heart specification, but before the heart primordium migrates to the ventral midline, the migration is unaffected but smaller, abnormal hearts result. Lithium treatment of cleavage stage embryos causes an increase in heart tissue. In severely dorsalized embryos, heart tissue can be found around the entire embryo with the exception of a small gap at the most dorsal point. This gap indicates that migration of the heart to the ventral midline does not occur in these embryos. Later in development, a centrally located, beating heart is observed in dorsalized embryos. The timing of its appearance suggests that it is formed by movements normally associated with heart morphogenesis rather than migration. © 1994 by Academic Press, Inc.",,89,0,,undefined,

We have recently employed a human liver cell line (HepG2) to assess the biological effects of pollutants at both cellular and DNA levels. A Neutral Red dye uptake assay was used to assess potential cytotoxic effects of xenobiotics. DNA damage was quantified using an unscheduled DNA synthesis assay that measures repair that is induced following exposure to genotoxic compounds. HepG2 cells responded to the known mutagens, 4-nitroquinoline N-oxide and methylmethane sulfonate, both in the Neutral Red assay for cytotoxicity and two DNA repair assays for genotoxicity (monitored autoradiographically or by liquid scintillation counting). The HepG2 DNA repair and cytotoxicity assays also responded to an extract (containing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) of sediment obtained from a polluted site in the Great Lakes. Results indicate that this system can be deployed further to assess potential cyto- and genotoxicity of pollutants. The development of human cell culture assays is a critical step towards a full assessment of the risk that such pollutants pose to human health. © 1994.",DNA repair | environmental screening methods | genotoxicity | HepG2 cells | mutagenesis | unscheduled DNA synthesis,18,0,,undefined,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada

Adequate biomass was acquired in single, 2-h collections to permit triplicate gas chromatographic analyses of 1-4 g samples for 36 organochlorine contaminants. Contaminant levels varied unpredictably but relatively little among samples taken at monthly intervals over the summer. Samples collected simultaneously from the two sides of the Detroit R. reflected local sediment contaminant patterns, suggesting limited dispersal by adults. Genus-specific differences in contaminant concentrations within the Hydropsychidae and Leptoceridae probably reflect differences in larval habitats and manner of feeding. Contaminant concentrations and relative composition paralleled published reports of contaminants in sediments from collection locations. St. Marys R. caddisflies contained contaminant levels indistinguishable from samples collected at reference sites. St. Clair R. samples contained high levels of compounds associated with petrochemical industries located in the river's upstream reaches. High levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and most other contaminants in Detroit R. samples reflected industrial loadings near Detroit, Michigan. Niagara R. samples contained elevated concentrations of PCBs and pesticides. Cluster analysis grouped samples into five clusters each with unique contaminant composition. These also corresponded to geographic origin: St. Marys, St. Clair, Detroit and upper and lower Niagara rivers.

It was shown that the steady state components of the sustained response f(n)(t) could be expressed by the summation of the waveforms obtained by shifting a fully masked response to a single cycle u(n)(t) within the stimulus with intervals equal to the integer times of the cycle. It has been pointed out that the spectra of f(a)(t) and u(n)(t) could be correlated with the following formula: [F(n)(ω)] = [U(n)(ω)](sin(n + 1)ωT/sinωT], where T stands for the cycle of the stimulus. From this formula, it was deduced that there would be peaks in the spectrum of the steady state response as the frequencies equaled to the integer times of the frequency of the stimulus, the higher the frequency of the stimulus, the less would be the harmonic components, and the frequency range of the steady state response was restricted by the frequency pass band of [U(n)(ω)]. These conclusions were tested and verified in chochlea potentials and brainstem auditory potentials, the cochlea potentials being recorded from the round window of inner ear of guinea pigs and the brainstem auditory potentials from the scalp. A comparison of the theoretical expectant and experimental results was also made quantitatively. The well fitting result was a strong support to our theory and gave a reasonable explanation to the 'frequency following' mechanism and the frequency nonlinearity phenomenon in biological systems, which was rather general for evoked potentials. Besides, a possible explanation was also given for the frequency limitation of auditory frequency following responses.",auditory evoked potentials | brainstem auditory evoked potential | cochlea potential | frequency following response,0,0,,undefined,

Levels of GUS enzyme activity produced by chimeric genes with or without the AMV leader sequence, in combination with either a CaMV 35S promoter or a duplicated-enhancer CaMV 35S promoter construct were assessed. In transient assay systems, the presence of a synthetic 40-base leader sequence lead to a 20-fold elevation in GUS activity when the constructs contained a native cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter, whereas a 4-fold elevated expression lebel was observed in constructs containing a duplicated-enhancer 35S promoter. Furthermore, elevated expression in chimeric constructs was influenced by the sequence context for translation initiation of the marker gene. In transgenic tobacco plants the mean values for steady-state expression of GUS-containing 35S/AMV constructs were elevated about 8-fold relative to plasmids containing the native 35S promoter alone. A quantitative PCR approach was used to assess relative transcript levels in plants expressing GUS from AMV-containing chimeric constructs. The results showed that elevated expression attributable to the AMV leader sequence was independent of abundance of the corresponding AMV-gus transcript, suggesting a post-transcriptional mechanism of action in vivo. Further, we describe the construction of general-purpose constitutive high expression plant promoter cassettes which incorporate the AMV translational enhancer sequence, as well a duplicated-enhancer 35S promoter in an optimized translational context. © 1993.",AMV leader | Gene expression | GUS (E. coli ß-glucuronidase) | Transgenic plants | Transient expression,123,0,,undefined,National Research Council Canada

Clearance rate was unrelated to bead concentration up to 100 beads μL-1, but was positively correlated with veliger shell length. Clearance rates of Dreissena veligers are within the range of those reported for marine bivalve veligers of similar size and for herbivorous Great Lakes microzooplankton, but are orders of magnitude lower than those of settled, conspecific adults. The impact of settled zebra mussel grazing activities on phytoplankton stocks may be up to 1162 times greater than that exerted by veliger populations in western Lake Erie. Based on 1990 size-frequency distributions and associated literature-derived clearance rates, reef-associated Dreissena populations in western Lake Erie (mean depth ∼7 m) possess a tremendous potential to filter the water column (up to 132 m3 m-2 day-1) and redirect energy from pelagic to benthic foodwebs.

A comparative EM morphological study of developing synaptic contacts also was done in the same tissue. We find that a few immature synaptic contacts are present at fetal (F) 75 days either in the marginal zone, which becomes layer 1, or in the deepest portion of the cortical plate, the future layer 6. At F90-140 days synaptic contacts are found throughout the cortical plate, but their density remains higher in lower cortical layers. By F140 days synaptic density averaged for all layers (10.9) is three times higher than at F90 days. Just before and after birth, synaptic density rises very rapidly to peak at postnatal (P)12 weeks (63) and then declines slowly to reach adult values (37.7) between 2–6 years. This pattern was further tested by comparing synaptic density in layer 2 which contains the last cells generated in the striate cortex to that in layer 6 which contains the first cells generated in the striate cortex. Layer 6 contained the first synapses, and had a higher density up to F140 days (an “inside-to-outside” distribution). Synaptic density was equal in the two layers at F152 days and P2 days, but by P12 weeks synaptic density in layer 2 was 27% higher than that in layer 6 (an “outside-to-inside” distribution). After P12 weeks, the synaptic density declined 51% in layer 2 and 21% in layer 6 so that both layers achieved similar densities by P6 years. A light and EM comparison of neuropil and synaptic contact morphology finds that, at each age up to birth, synapses in layer 2 are generally less mature than those in layer 6, but these differences disappear shortly after birth. Between P6-24 weeks, synaptic contacts throughout the cortex acquire a mature morphology that clearly differentiates between asymmetric and symmetric types, although asymmetric contacts continue to acquire more postsynaptic density until adulthood. This complex developmental pattern suggests a sequence for synaptic developments which is more related to neuron birthdate than to the arrival of extrinsic pathways or developmental events occurring in specific laminae. © 1992, Cambridge University Press.

The objective of this study is to investigate the relationship between the acute lethality in fish and in aquatic plants. The study shows linear relationships between the plant-water and fish-water bioconcentration factors and the 1-octanol-water partition coefficient, indicating that plant-water and fish-water exchange are largely controlled by the chemical's tendency to partition between the lipids of the plants or fish and the water. The toxicokinetics in both the plants and the fish involve 'passive' transport phenomena, which can be described by a lipid-water kinetic model. Toxicity data demonstrate that the acute lethality of chlorobenzene and chlorobiphenyl congeners in fish is associated with an internal concentration in the fish of approximately 6330 μmol/L. Based on the similarity of the lethal internal concentration among the chlorobenzene congeners and between various aquatic organisms, it is hypothesized that the acute lethal toxicity of chlorobenzenes in plants and fish are similar, which would provide a basis for the extrapolation of toxicity data between fish and aquatic plants.",,11,0,,undefined,

In order to understand better the role of GABA during primate visual cortex development, we have examined the time course of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor ontogenesis in 18 Macaca nemestrina monkeys ranging from fetal day 61 (F61d) to adulthood. The GABA and benzodiazepine binding sites of the GABA(A) receptor were detected by 3H-muscimol (3H-MS) and 3H-flunitrazepam (3H-FZ), respectively. GABA(B) receptors were detected by 3H-baclofen (3H-BA). All ligands were visualized by in vitro autoradiography. Quantitative analysis of film density was done to compare laminar changes during pre- and postnatal development. Saturation binding experiments were done for MS and FZ binding sites to determine receptor number (B(max)) and affinity (K(d)) at selected pre- and postnatal ages. Both MS and FZ binding sites were present at F61d-72d throughout the cortical plate and marginal zone. FZ binding sites were more dense than MS binding sites over the cortical plate at young ages and were especially dense over the marginal zone. FZ binding sites also were present in lesser amounts over the subplate and intermediate zone, but not over the subventricular zone. By F119d-126d, layer 4 could be distinguished by its higher density for both ligands. The basic adult laminar pattern was established for both MS and BZ binding sites by birth (birth = F165d-170d). After birth, MS density increases dramatically in all layers, but layer 4C remains most dense to adulthood. FZ labeling is heavy in both layers 4 and 3 at birth but after 4 weeks after birth (P4 wk) it declines somewhat in the supragranular layers so that layer 4C now predominates. Labeling in layers 5/6 virtually disappears after birth. BA binding sites were present at F126d, at which time layer 4 was slightly lighter than the remainder of striate cortex; this laminar pattern remained basically the same throughout our series to adulthood. Competitive binding of agonist and antagonists for the GABA(A) receptor showed that MS binding characteristics were similar at F126d and P8.5 years (yr). MS binding site B(max) was about 8% of adult values at F72d, 24% by F126d, and 56% at F152d. B(max) then rose rapidly after birth to peak at P18wk at 169% of adult values, and then declined to P1yr. A second peak of 143% was found around P3.5yr, with adult values reached by P8.5yr. K(d) values for MS at F126d showed evidence for two binding sites (34 nM and 4 nM) that existed up to P1d, and only one site (26-65 nM) after this age. The B(max) for FZ was 27% of adult values at F126d, peaked at 113% adult value at P18wk, and declined slowly to adult levels by P8.5yr. K(d) values for FZ found one site at all ages. Binding for FZ is proportionately higher in early development with a ratio of 1:2-3 FZ:MS, but in the postnatal cortex MS binding dominates with a ratio of 1:4-6 FZ:MS. The present study demonstrates the early prenatal occurrence in monkey visual cortex of both the MS and FZ binding sites of the GABA(A) receptor and also of the GABA(B) receptor. The GABA(A) receptor first appears near the age when GABAergic neurons can be detected immunocytochemically (Hendrickson et al., 1988; Meinicke and Rakic, 1989), but before synapses are found in significant numbers (Zielinski and Hendrickson, 1990). Although GABA(A) receptors are normally associated with inhibitory synaptic circuits, these data suggest that the initial expression of GABA receptors is not dependent on synaptic contact and that GABA(A) and its receptors may play some neurotrophic role in early cortical development. Postnatal changes in receptor distribution and number are more closely correlated with synaptic density changes.",,44,0,,undefined,

Number of invertebrates in a sample was the primary determinant of sample sorting time. Amount of detritus, occurrence of filamentous algae (Cladophora) and source stream contributed significant but minor additional variability to estimates (cumulative R2 = 0.95). When number of animals was excluded as a variable, amount of detritus and presence/absence of Cladophora alone could be used to predict sorting time (R2 = 0.81). A typical sample containing Cladophora required 29% longer to sort than samples containing equivalent amounts of organic material but no Cladophora. The influence of sampler size and subsampling on processing and sorting time are considered. A general equation was derived to provide guidelines for selecting a size of stream sampler that subsequently minimizes total processing time required to estimate density of benthos with acceptable, constant precision. Overall sample processing and sorting time are reduced by using a smaller sampler or by subsampling only if benthic densities of animals are high.

A head tube is an inexpensive, easily-built alternative to a current meter for measuring water velocity in streams and rivers. When water flowing in a channel is obstructed by an object, its depth increases at the point of zero velocity (stagnation zone). The difference between the flowing-water depth and depth in the stagnation zone is the head (h). A head tube consists of a clear, hollow, 2.5 cm diameter acrylic tube and a sliding sleeve made of clear plastic. The tube is placed vertically on the river bottom. The difference (head) between water level inside the tube and the height of water against the tube's upstream face is measured against a scale (cm s-1) drawn on the sleeve, which provides a direct reading of velocity. Graduations of the scale are calculated from a hydrodynamic equation relating mean velocity (Ū) to head (h): Ū = (2 gh)0.5, where g is acceleration due to gravity. When tested in a laboratory flume, the head tube gave very precise estimates of velocity (R2 of relationship = 0.98), although the original calibration scale overestimated current meter-measured velocity by 22 percent. The relationship between head tube and current meter estimates of mean velocity determined in a river with stony substrate was less precise than the correspondence observed in the laboratory (R2 = 0.81). However, estimates of discharge based on head tube measurements were within 8 percent of estimates based on current meter readings. © 1991 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",flow | hydrodynamics | measurement | meter | stream | water velocity,5,0,,undefined,

Chemical levels were greatest in P. notatus, reflecting its greater exposure to contaminated sediments. Habitat partitioning is a major factor regulating contaminant levels. Interspecific differences in contaminant levels have important implications for fugacity models which would predict that these differences should not exist. Although chemical and physiological parameters may determine which contaminants have the potential to bioaccumulate, it is the regulation of exposure through ecological processes that will determine the degree to which that potential is realized. -from Authors",,25,0,,undefined,

Population growth rates and relative competitive abilities of the rotifer Keratella cochlearis f. tecta and the small‐bodied cladoceran Daphnia ambigua were studied under different schedules of food addition but equal total food quantity (per 4‐day interval). The initial population growth rate of Keratella was significantly affected by the feeding schedule and by the presence of competitors, while that of Daphnia was affected by neither factor. Population densities of both species tended to increase as the frequency of food addition increased. 2. Daphnia suppressed and excluded Keratella from mixed‐species cultures when food was provided intermittently at a high concentration, but it failed to exclude the rotifer when food was provided in a near‐continuous supply at low concentration. Keratella had only a minor suppressive effect on Daphnia in all mixed‐species treatments. 3. Starvation experiments indicate that Daphnia is able to withstand food shortages for significantly longer periods of time than Keratella. These and other results indicate that the outcome of interspecific competition between these species may be influenced by me frequency and concentration at which food is supplied. Daphnia ambigua is competitively superior to K. cochlearis when food is concentrated or ‘pulsed’, but much less so when ambient food levels are chronically low. Patterns of food availability may have important effects in determining the relative abundance of rotifers and small cladocerans in natural zooplankton communities. Copyright © 1991, Wiley Blackwell.

The small-bodied cladoceran Ceriodaphnia dubia suppressed Keratella exclusively through EC, while a slightly larger species (Daphnia ambigua) and subadults (Daphnia pulex) of two much larger-bodied cladocerans suppressed Keratella primarily through IC. Suppression by EC occurred in all treatments only after food was depleted below the concentration necessary to support maximal rotifer population growth, while suppression by IC occurred at both high and low food concentrations. IC should favor invulnerable rotifer speices, many of which are large-bodied, while EC should favor rotifer species with low food requirements, which tend to be small-bodied. -from Authors",,72,0,,undefined,

Using an expression plasmid containing the highly active trc (trp-lac) promoter, several plant ALS constructs were made containing successive in-frame truncations from the 5′ end of the coding region. Functional complementation by these plant ALS constructs of a S. typhimurium mutant devoid of ALS enzymic activity was assayed on minimal medium. Truncations which eliminated a large portion of the transit peptide coding sequence proved to act as efficient ALS genes in the bacterial host. Truncations close to the putative processing site of the plant protein were inactive in the complementation test. A full length copy of the gene, including the entire transit peptide coding region, was also inactive. The efficiency of the complementation, estimated by comparison to the growth rate of wild-type S. typhimurium, was found to correlate with levels of ALS activity in the transformed bacteria. Specific mutations, known to produce herbicide resistance in plants, were introduced into the truncated ALS coding sequence by site-directed mutagenesis. When expressed in bacteria these constructs conferred a herbicide resistance phenotype on the host.

The leaf disks were inoculated with a non-oncogenic Agrobacterium tumefadens strain MP90 carrying a binary vector plasmid pBI121 which contains a chimeric nopaline synthase (NOS) promoter driven neomycin phosphotransferase (NPT II) gene and a cauliflower mosaic virus 35S (CaMV35S) promoter driven, ß-glucuronidase (GUS) marker gene. The inoculated leaf disks, pre-cultured for 10 days on non-selective shoot regeneration medium, formed light green meristematic regions on selection medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin. These meristematic regions developed into transformed shoots at a frequency of 6.5% on a second selection medium containing 25 μg/ml kanamycin. The selected shoots were multiplied on shoot proliferation medium in the presence of kanamycin. All such shoots were resistant to kanamycin and expressed varying levels of NPT II and GUS enzyme activity. Histochemical assays for GUS activity indicated that the 35S promoter was highly active in meristematic cells of shoot and root apices. Molecular analysis of each transgenic clone confirmed the integration of both marker genes into the strawberry genome. Leaf disks prepared from transformed plants, when put through the second selection cycle on kanamycin, formed callus and exhibited GUS activity. The rooted transformed plants were grown in a greenhouse for further characterization.

Liver concentrations of octachlorostyrene (115 μg kg−1), hexachlorobenzene (30 μg kg−1), and pentachlorobenzene (1.5 μg kg−1) were elevated in resident duck populations relative to migratory populations (56, 8.7, and 0.4 μg kg−1, respectively). Comparison of residue concentrations in resident open water ducks (redheads) with resident marsh ducks (mallards) indicated there was no significant difference (P > 0.10) between the two species. The exposure of resident duck populations suggests that the transport and fate of organochlorinated compounds in the Huron-Erie corridor are being regulated by physical and biological properties of the delta area. Low level discharges of persistent, bioaccumulating compounds into the upstream waters can result in an increasing concentration of these substances in the wetland area and in the associated food web. © 1990, International Association for Great Lakes Research.

Keratella cochlearis was excluded in <8 days by the large cladocerans Daphnia pulex and D. magna, probably through both interference and exploitative competition. On the other hand, K. cochlearis persisted for 8 weeks with two small cladocerans (Bosmina longirostris and Ceriodaphnia dubia) and excluded a third small cladoceran (D. ambigua). Similarly, Synchaeta oblonga coexisted with B. longirostris for >7 weeks, and K. testudo coexisted with D. ambigua for >4 weeks. Coexistence of small cladocerans and rotifers was always accompanied by suppression of one or both populations, probably primarily if not exclusively by exploitative competition for limiting food resources. These results indicate that the competitive dominance of cladocerans over rotifers decreases markedly with cladoceran body size and that factors other than body size may determine the competitive outcome between rotifers and small cladocerans. Our study provides a mechanistic explanation for a commonly observed pattern in natural zooplankton communities: planktonic rotifers often are abundant when only small cladocerans occur but typically are rare when large cladocerans are present. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Body size | Cladocera | Competition | Rotifera | Zooplankton,86,0,,undefined,

This B. napus acetolactate synthase gene encodes a deduced polypeptide sequence of 637 amino acids which is 85% homologous to the corresponding proposed gene product from Arabidopsis thaliana. Peptide domains recently associated with herbicide resistance/sensitivity are conserved between the two sequences. From Southern analysis we conclude that the gene isolated is one member of a multigene acetolactate synthase gene family comprising four or five members. A probe spanning the presumptive transit peptide sequence of this gene was shown by Southern analysis to hybridize to a unique sequence in the B. napus genome. This unique probe was used to analyse DNA from B. campestris and B. oleracea, the presumed progenitors of B. napus. On the basis of restriction fragment length polymorphism, we conclude that the B. napus gene isolated here originated in B. campestris. Total acetolactate synthase-homologous transcripts were analysed in a variety of B. napus tissues, and showed preferential accumulation in rapidly growing material. The genomic clone was mutated in vitro at codon 173 to replace a proline residue with serine. This was re-introduced into plants, using Agrobacterium vectors, producing a herbicide-resistant phenotype which is characteristic of the predicted gene product. © 1989 Springer-Verlag.",Acetolactate synthase | Brassica napus | DNA sequence | Herbicide resistance | Oilseed rape,53,0,,undefined,

Increasing the plasmid DNA concentration (0-150μg ml-1) resulted in higher levels of transient CAT expression. In jack pine, linearized plasmid gave 2.5 times higher levels of CAT enzyme activity than circular.

All rights reserved. In barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are induced by anaerobiosis in both aleurone layers and roots. Under aerobic conditions, developing seeds of cv Himalaya accumulate ADH activity, which survives seed drying and rehydration. This activity consists almost entirely of the ADH1 homodimer. Activity of LDH also increases during seed development, but the level of activity in dry or rehydrated seeds is very low, indicating that this enzyme may not be involved in anaerobic glycolysis during the initial stages of germination. In contrast to ADH, the LDH isozymes present in developing seeds are similar to those found in uninduced and induced roots. Developmental expression of ADH and LDH was monitored from 0 to 24 days postgermination. Neither activity was induced to any extent in the germinating seeds; however, both enzymes were highly induced by anoxia in root tissue during development. Based on gel electrophoresis, this increase in activity results from the differential expression of different Adh and Ldh genes in root tissue. The changes in ADH and LDH activity levels were matched by changes in the amount of these particular proteins, indicating that the increase in activity results from de novo synthesis of these two proteins. The level of inducible LDH activity in an ADH1− mutant was not found to differ from cv Himalaya. We suggest that although the ADH− plants are more susceptible to flooding, they are not capable of responding to the lack of ADH1 activity by increasing the amount of LDH activity in root tissue.",,47,1,,undefined,

All current evidence indicates that olfaction is a major mediator of chemical signals and is involved in diverse teleost behavior. This paper describes the morphological components and the basic principles of developmental patterns of the olfactory organ as well as cellular differentiation of receptors in rainbow trout Oncorhynchus mykiss (formerly Salmo gairdneri). The olfactory organ originates from an anlage formed by the ectoderm on the ventrolateral part of the head during stage 19 (11 d postfertilization). Ciliated receptor cells appear at stage 24 (day 18) and dominate until immature microvillar receptor cells develop in stage-28 (day 26) embryos. During this period, the olfactory placode continues a lateral and upward migration. At stage 29, the day of hatching, the olfactory groove is enclosed by flaps of skin, and by stage 33, distinct anterior and posterior nares are formed. Spontaneous electrical activity is recorded from the olfactory mucosa as early as stage 25, and neural responses to chemical stimuli are induced from stage-26 embryos that contain sparse ciliated receptor cells. Stereochemical specificity of receptor responses is evident at these stages. We conclude that the olfactory receptor has two ontogenetically distinct forms, ciliated and microvillar. By the time of hatching, both cell types are mature and capable of responding and discriminating among chemical stimuli. The functional distinction of the olfactory system is discussed further in relation to the gustatory system, which is endodermal in origin and is still incomplete at hatching. © By the American Fisheries Society 1989.",,62,0,,undefined,

However, it is often difficult to obtain adequate material for gas chromatographic analyses using benthic sampling methods. Alternatively, one can collect the terrestrial adult stages of aquatic insects. We captured adult Trichoptera and Ephemeroptera at night at four contaminated sites on the Detroit and St. Clair rivers, and at several uncontaminated central Ontario locations. Modified Pennsylvania style light traps containing dry ice as a killing/preserving agent attracted large numbers of insects. Adult Trichoptera were active throughout the summer, but catches were greatest in late June. Hexagenia (Ephemeroptera: Ephemeridae) abundance was very low except during 2 weeks in late June. Air temperature, wind velocity, and wind direction greatly affected catches. Gas chromatographic analyses of central Ontario samples revealed low but detectable (<1 μg/kg) levels of individual PCB congeners, and relatively high concentrations of some pesticides. Samples weighing 0.75 g dry weight yielded contaminant estimates as precise as larger samples. Neither storage time nor storage temperature influenced analyses. Adult insects collected near the Detroit and St. Clair rivers carried significantly higher body burdens of nearly all contaminants considered than adult insects from central Ontario sites.

Even at high population densities (300–2000 ind. 1 −1 ), only one of five small cladoceran species (adult body length <1 mm) significantly suppressed population growth of the rotifer Keratella cochlearis through interference (encounter) competition. At 500 ind. H, adults of D. ambigua (0.96 mm body length) imposed an instantaneous per capita death rate of 0.21 day −1 on this rotifer. These short‐term experiments may have underestimated cladoceran interference because newborn rotifers were rarely present. 2. Newborn rotifers (<12 h old) were much more susceptible than adult rotifers (> 24 h old) to interference from Ceriodaphnia dubia. All of the small cladoceran species tested were very much less likely than large Daphnia (body lengths >1.2 mm) to interfere with K. cochlearis, but perhaps at high population densities they could suppress population growth of susceptible rotifer species by damaging, and possibly eating, relatively small and soft‐bodied newborn individuals. 3. K. cochlearis of the tecta form, without a posterior spine, produced offspring of the typica form, with a posterior spine, in the presence of C. dubia. This developmental response is stimulated by at least several, and possibly all, cladocerans and probably reduces the susceptibility of the rotifer to cladoceran interference.

The alpha‐adrenergic agonist phenylephrine caused secretory granule depletion from Bowman's glands; the alpha‐adrenergic antagonist phentolamine partially blocked this effect. These observations were quantified using light microscopic computer‐assisted morphometric techniques. Both drugs caused morphological signs of electrolye/water transport. Adrenergic axonal varicosities were identified by the presence of small granular vesicles (SGVs, 45–60 nm in diameter) containing electron‐dense material that was enhanced by 5‐hydroxydopamine loading and chromaffin reaction fixation techniques. Throughout the lamina propria, small fascicles with axons containing SGVs as well as varicosities and terminals with SGVs were located adjacent to blood vessels, Bowman's gland acini, and melanocytes. Mean vesicle diameters at these sites were 54 ± 7 nm, 50 = 9 nm, and 56 ± 8 nm, respectively; varicosities were located approximately 0.1–1.0 μm from their presumed cellular targets. Axonal varicosities containing small agranular vesicles (AGVs, 65 ± 8 nm in diameter), identified as cholinergic by their size and by the absence of electron‐dense material after 5‐hydroxydopamine loading and chromaffin reaction fixation, were located between adjacent acinar cells. In addition, adrenergic varicosities containing SGVs (56 ± 6 nm in diameter) were found within 1 μm of blood vessels associated with Bowman's gland ducts and sustentacular cells near the base of the olfactory epithelium.

Attempts to use the Escherichia coli β-glucuronidase gene (β-GUS) as a marker gene revealed very high levels of β-GUS-like activity in electroporated protoplasts. This activity was mainly due to a small molecule and may mask successful transformation since β-GUS-like activity increased when plasmid DNA was present during electroporation. © 1988 Springer-Verlag.,,39,0,,undefined,

Ciliated receptor cells first appeared when the olfactory placode was folded to form a groovelike structure rostrad to the eye at stage 24 (day 18; 18 days postfertilization). Ciliated receptor cells predominated until immature microvillar receptor cells developed in stage 28 (day 26) embryos. At stage 29, the day of hatching, the anterior edge of the olfactory epithelium contained only ciliated receptor cells, and the midregion contained both ciliated and microvillar receptor cells. Spontaneous neural firing activity was recorded from the olfactory mucosa as early as stage 25. The neural responses to amino acids were initially recorded from stage 26 embryos, containing sparse ciliated receptor cells with a few short cilia. The D‐enantiomers of amino acids were less effective. From these results we concluded that in rainbow trout the olfactory receptor cell has two separate morphological forms, ciliated and microvillar. These are ontogenetically distinct; the ciliated receptor cells preceded the microvillar. The ciliated receptor cells respond to amino acid stimulation. Copyright © 1988 Alan R.

Principal component analysis accounted for 84% of variation in contaminant concentration among samples. The principal components (PCs) correlated highly with concentrations of 9 hexa-, hepta-, and octachlorobiphenyls (PC-I; 46% of overall variation), 4 tetra- and pentachlorobiphenyls (PC-II; 17% of variation), QCB, HCB, and OCS (PC-III; 8%), and 2 trichlorobiphenyls (PCs IV and V; each 6% of variation). Values of PC-I were significantly greater among Detroit River than among St. Clair River samples. Values of PC-II were highest for samples from upstream stations on the two rivers. Values of PC-III were higher for St. Clair River samples than for Detroit River samples. These trends are consistent with patterns observed in other biota and sediment previously collected from equivalent sites. Contaminant levels also varied among taxa collected from the same site, possibly because of different larval feeding habits or microdistribution, or adult flight ability.

Few sustentacular cells showed morphological signs of secretion, suggesting a low rate of baseline secretory activity. 3) The nuclear region contained the cylindrical nucleus surrounded by a thin band of cytoplasm containing bundles of filaments. 4) The central stalk contained filamentous arrays, Golgi‐like cisternae, multivesicular bodies, and peroxisomes. Cytoplasmic veils that extended from the central stalk contained filamentous aggregates. 5) The basilar expansion had a complex series of lateral and basal folds. The lateral folds enveloped extracellular material and nonmyelinated axons of the receptor neurons. The basal folds formed complex interdigitations with the basal lamina, particularly in regions occupied by blood vessels and the acini of Bowman's glands in the subjacent lamina propria. These characteristics, and the presence of endosome‐like vesicles and mitochondria, suggest that the basilar expansion is metabolically active and participates in cellular transport of material. Treatment with the odorant 2‐isobutyl‐3‐methoxypyrazine caused ultrastructural changes in the apical and supranuclear regions that were associated with secretion and in the basilar expansion region that were indicative of an increase in metabolic and transport activity.

Topical application of the odorants guaiacol (10-3 mol/l, 1-30 min) and 2-isobutyl-3-methoxypyrazine (IBMP, 10-5-10-3 mol/l, 15 min) caused time- and concentration-dependent reductions in the secretory granule content of acinar cells of the superficial Bowman's glands (sBG) and moderate to extensive vacuolation in acinar cells of sBG and deep olfactory glands (dG). 2. Topical application of 9.8 mg/ml scopolamine 10 min before 10-4 mol/l IBMP significantly reduced the amount of secretory granule depletion from sBG compared to that seen with IBMP alone and resulted in less extensive vacuolation in sBG and dG acinar cells. The i.p. injection of 42 mg/kg propranolol 10 min before topical application of 10-4 mol/l IBMP had no effect on the action of IBMP. 3. Guaiacol and IBMP also had time- and concentration-dependent effects on the secretory activity of sustentacular cells in the olfactory epithelium. The protrusion of secretory material into the mucociliary matrix that covers the epithelial surface and vacuolation within the secretory material resulted from odorant application. Scopolamine and propranolol had no effects on the action of IBMP on sustentacular cell secretory activity. 4. When applied in the vapor phase, guaiacol elicited action potentials recorded from individual olfactory receptor neurons; the impulse frequency was concentration-dependent and showed tonic and phasic components when the duration of stimulation was varied. Low to moderate concentrations of IBMP delivered in the vapor phase evoked monophasic negative slow voltage transients recorded from the surface of the olfactory mucosa. The amplitudes of these transients increased with increasing stimulus concentrations. Higher concentrations or longer stimulus durations evoked longer-latency positive-voltage generating processes and negative afterpotentials. The properties of the electrophysiological responses to both odorants were characteristic of responses evoked by a wide variety of 'typical' odorants. © 1987 Springer-Verlag.",,18,0,,undefined,

Genera such as Dinobryon, Oscillatoria, and Gymnodinium tended to be found at discrete depths whereas other genera such as Cryptomonas and Rhodomonas tended to be more uniformly distributed throughout the water column. The discrete depth distribution of some of these genera compared with the weak thermal stabilization of the area suggests depth selection and habitat preference within the algal community. Physical processes probably played a major role in regulating the timing and duration of vertical diatom pulses, and resuspension from the sediment played a major role as to the timing of the autumn growth. Vertical mixing in the nearshore zone was sufficient for some diatom genera such as Tabellaria to maintain populations throughout the summer. These mixing processes, however, affect the stability of community structures and associations that develop within the water column.

Upwellings were characterized as being temporal displacements of nearshore water masses which returned at the end of each event. Plankton communities of the nearshore area were displaced with the water mass and therefore received little or no benefit from the upwelled nutrient rich hypolimnetic waters. Evidence is provided to suggest that diatom species such as Asterionella formosa Hass and Fragilaria crotonensis Kitton were able to grow in the upwelled hypolimnetic water, and upwellings might be a mechanism to inoculate these species into the epilimnion of deep lakes prior to the autumn overturn.

Gustatory responses to amino acids and derivatives obtained from the palatine nerve (VIIth cranial nerve) of rainbow trout (Salmogairdneri) were studied. 2. The response to an amino acid was characterized by its fast-adapting, phasic nature that returned to baseline within 5 s during continuous stimulation. 3. Complete recovery of the response took place 120 s after stimulation when tested with two identical stimuli given successively (Figs. 2, 3). 4. Among common amino acids tested, only L-isomers of proline, hydroxyproline, alanine, leucine, and phenylalanine were stimulatory (Table 1), demonstrating that the facial taste system is more narrowly-tuned to amino acid stimuli than the olfactory system. The arginine derivative, L-α-amino-β-guanidinopropionic acid (L-AGPA) and L-argininic acid, and betaine were also effective. 5. Concentration-response relations, when plotted semi-logarithmically, were generally sigmoidal, saturating at higher concentrations (>1 mM) (Fig. 5). The threshold concentration for L-proline, the most effective amino acid tested, was estimated to be 50 nM. The thresholds for other stimulatory chemicals ranged between 1 and 100 μM. 6. L-AGPA, though having higher threshold (10 μM), could induce responses three times the magnitude of that of L-proline at 1 mM. 7. The stimulatory activity of heterocyclic-imino acids having 4-, 5-, and 6-membered rings and also of thioproline and hydroxyproline suggests that the receptor recognizes primarily the imino acid region (Fig. 6). 8. Taste responses to amino acids were independent of pH, except that arginine analogues were only active at basic pHs (Fig. 7 and Table 3). larginine was active only at pHs higher than 8.5. The palatal chemoreceptors were stimulated by waters with pHs below 7.0, suggesting the existence of receptors for pH and/or CO2 (Fig. 7). © 1983 Springer-Verlag.",,56,0,,undefined,

The proportion of larvae departing from the substrate was independent of benthic density, amount of detritus, and interactions between these 2 variables. In spring, departure of larvae of both species was a positive linear function of current velocity during daylight hours. In darkness, departure of B. tricaudatus larvae became a negative linear function of current velocity. Nocturnal drift of E. inermis larvae was minimal at a mean current velocity of 25 cm.s-1 and greater at both higher and lower velocities. None of the factors tested influenced departure of B. tricaudatus larvae in autumn experiments. Dead larvae were eroded from the substrate in much smaller proportions than were their live counterparts. This suggests that appearance in the water column of live animals is the direct or indirect consequence of individuals' behaviour. Departure of animals during daytime is largely passive in nature, whereas a substantial proportion of nocturnal drift probably results from active desertion of the substrate.-Author",,43,0,,undefined,

Eggs hatch in August and larvae grow rapidly in autumn and spring, but not during winter. Baetis tricaudatus Dodds produces three cohorts per year. Emergence periods occur in early June, July and early September. Only one cohort overwinters as larvae. Microdistribution of both species is controlled largely by the discharge pattern of the river. During 1978, a year of frequent floods, animals were equally distributed among slow and fast water portions of the river. Nocturnal drift densities of both species were much greater in slow than in fast water areas. During 1979, a year of relatively stable flow, benthic larval densities were significantly greater in fast water than in slow water. Early instar E. inermis larvae are most abundant in nearshore areas, but move to deeper water in late autumn. Baetis tricaudatus larvae are seldom numerous in near‐shore areas. Densities of both species were positively associated with concentrations of detritus and of other invertebrates, but only when relationships were considered in areas of similar current velocity independently of season.

Laboratory studies showed that the number of individuals appearing in the drift was a linear function of the duration of the preceding photoperiod. Nymphs had a greater propensity to drift when they were not in a state of active growth than when they were growing. The tendency of individuals in a single laboratory population to drift was observed to change under conditions of constant temperature and randomized photoperiod. This suggests that the shift was due to some internal physiological change rather than to an external cue. It is suggested that drift in E. subvaria functions as a method relocation from fast-water areas to slow-water pools and stream margins. Redistribution to these areas may reduce mortality incurred during spring run-off and during emergence. © 1979 Dr. W. Junk b.v.

This dependence was expressed by the equation ks = 0.72 + 0.26 c. The water column oxygen demand of the harbour was determined experimentally and revealed a significant dependence on oxygen concentration. It was estimated that over 80% of the oxygen supplied to the harbour was used within the water column. The sediment oxygen consumed about 18% of the oxygen entering the harbour and was relatively most important in the early stages of stratification when the hypolimnetic dissolved oxygen concentrations were high.

Experiments conducted in an artificial stream showed that significantly more nymphs drifted from an inorganic substrate at a mean current velocity of 28.5 cm s−1 than at 18.5 cm s−1. Drift density, however, was not affected. Disproportionately large numbers of nymphs drifted while current velocities were being increased from 18.5 to 28.5 cm s−1. Both drift numbers and drift density were greater in turbid water, after the addition of large amounts of inorganic sediment, than under clear‐flowing conditions during dark periods but not in the light. The interaction of increasing current velocity and sediment levels resulted in a significantly greater number of drifting nymphs under lighted conditions. Minor spates which do not seriously disturb the stream bed may initiate significant increases in macroinvertebrate drift. Copyright © 1977, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved",,38,0,,undefined,
