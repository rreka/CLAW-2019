    "\n",
    "### The plan\n",
    "We're going to work with Python, and do this entire workshop within this Jupyter Notebook. The intended audience for this workshop is the librarian with no programming skills. In this three-hour workshop, we will:\n",
    "* [set-up a Jupyter Notebook environment, and get oriented](#Jupyter-Notebook)(Part I)\n",
    "* [a crash-course on programming in Python](#A-crash-course-in-Python) (Part I)\n",
    "* querying the Scopus API to get data, and import it into pandas (Part II)\n",
    "* data analysis and manipulation using pandas (Part II)\n",
    "* use Python to access a library link resolver (Part II)\n",
